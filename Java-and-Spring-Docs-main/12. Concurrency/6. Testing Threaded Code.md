# Testing Threaded Code

Writing correct multi-threaded code is tricky. Testing doesn't guarantee it's faultless, but can reduce risks.
This section recommends the creation of tests designed to expose issues in threaded environments.

**Example:** If you're building a website that expects many users at once (each user being like a thread), you'd want to simulate many users interacting simultaneously to see if any issues arise.

# Recommendations

- Consider potential threading issues if you see failures.
- Before tackling multi-threaded issues, ensure the basic (non-threaded) version of the code works.

**Example:** Before worrying about how a website performs with 1000 users, make sure it works perfectly with just one.

# Make Your Threaded Code Pluggable

The ability to run the code in different settings is beneficial.

**Example:** A video game might be designed to work both in single-player mode (one thread) and in multi-player mode (multiple threads).

# Make Your Threaded Code Tunable

Adjusting the number of threads can optimize performance.

**Example:** Think of a call center. Depending on call volume, you may need to adjust the number of available representatives (threads).

# Run with More Threads Than Processors

By forcing task switching, potential issues may be exposed.

**Example:** If a computer has 4 cores, you might run a test with 8 threads to ensure that the system handles task-switching efficiently.

# Run on Different Platforms

Different operating systems handle threading differently. Testing on multiple platforms ensures broader correctness.

**Example:** An app might work fine on Windows but face concurrency issues on macOS.

# Instrument Your Code to Try and Force Failures

Manipulating the order of thread execution can increase the chances of detecting threading bugs.

### 1. Hand-Coded Instrumentation

- **Definition**: Manually inserting calls into your code that affect the order of thread execution.
- **Example**:

  ```java
  public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {
      if(hasNext()) {
          String url = urlGenerator.next();
          Thread.yield(); // Hand-coded instrumentation for testing
          updateHasNext();
          return url;
      }
      return null;
  }
  ```

- **Pros**:
  - Direct control over specific test conditions.
- **Cons**:
  - Requires manual insertion.
  - Potentially disruptive to the original code.
  - Uncertainty about where and what calls to insert.

### 2. Automated Instrumentation

- **Definition**: Using tools/frameworks to programmatically insert calls affecting thread execution.
- **Example**:

  ```java
  public class ThreadJigglePoint {
      public static void jiggle() {
          // Logic to influence thread execution
      }
  }

  // Usage:
  public synchronized String nextUrlOrNull() {
      if(hasNext()) {
          ThreadJigglePoint.jiggle();
          String url = urlGenerator.next();
          ThreadJigglePoint.jiggle();
          updateHasNext();
          return url;
      }
      return null;
  }
  ```

- **Pros**:

  - More consistent than hand-coded.
  - Comprehensive testing of various conditions.
  - Less intrusive to the original code.

- **Cons**:
  - Might need external dependencies or tools.
