There are several thread-safe collections which became part of jdk in the `java.util.concurrent` package.

`ConcurrentHashMap` implementation performs better than `HashMap` in nearly all situations.

- `HashMap` is not thread-safe because it doesn't provide any built-in mechanisms to handle concurrent access by multiple threads. When multiple threads access a `HashMap` simultaneously, they can disrupt its internal data structure, leading to unexpected behavior.

- `ConcurrentHashMap` is designed to allow multiple threads to read and modify it safely. It achieves this through a combination of strategies, including partitioning the map into segments, so different threads can access different segments concurrently without locking the entire map. Each segment functions like a mini `HashMap` with its own lock.

```java
    // Using HashMap (not thread-safe)
    Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();
    hashMap.put("A", 1);
    hashMap.put("B", 2);

    // Using ConcurrentHashMap (thread-safe)
    Map<String, Integer> concurrentHashMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
    concurrentHashMap.put("A", 1);
    concurrentHashMap.put("B", 2);
```

There are several others:

- ### `ReentrantLock`

  `ReentrantLock` is a synchronization mechanism that allows you to create more flexible and fine-grained control over concurrency than the built-in synchronization provided by the `synchronized` keyword. It is `reentrant` which means a thread that holds the lock can reacquire it without blocking itself

  ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

    public class ReentrantLockExample {
        private static ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
                lock.lock(); // Thread 1 acquires the lock
                try {
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 is in the critical section");
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulating some work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock(); // Thread 1 releases the lock
                }
            });

            Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
                lock.lock(); // Thread 2 acquires the lock
                try {
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 is in the critical section");
                    Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulating some work
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock(); // Thread 2 releases the lock
                }
            });

            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }
    }


  ```

  - ### Scenarios where `ReentrantLock` can be a better choice

    - 1. #### Timeouts for Lock Acquisition:

         Sometimes, you may want to avoid a situation where your application gets stuck because a thread is indefinitely waiting to acquire a lock. With ReentrantLock, you can use the tryLock() method to attempt to acquire a lock and specify a maximum time to wait for the lock. If the lock can't be acquired within the specified time, the thread can take alternative actions. This is useful for avoiding potential deadlocks.

         ```java
            ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
            if (lock.tryLock(10, TimeUnit.SECONDS)) {
                try {
                    // Critical section
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            } else {
                // Handle the case where the lock couldn't be acquired within 10 seconds.
            }
         ```

- ### `Semaphore`

  A `semaphore` is a synchronization primitive used in concurrent programming to control access to a limited number of resources. It allows multiple threads to access a shared resource or perform a specific action, but it restricts the number of concurrent accesses to a specified limit. Semaphore can be thought of as a counter that keeps track of available permits, and threads must acquire a permit before they can proceed.

  ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

    public class SemaphoreExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(3); // Initialize a semaphore with 3 permits

            // Thread 1
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    semaphore.acquire(); // Thread 1 acquires a permit
                    System.out.println("Thread 1 is doing some work.");
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work
                    semaphore.release(); // Thread 1 releases the permit
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            // Thread 2
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    semaphore.acquire(); // Thread 2 acquires a permit
                    System.out.println("Thread 2 is doing some work.");
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work
                    semaphore.release(); // Thread 2 releases the permit
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            // Thread 3
            Thread thread3 = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    semaphore.acquire(); // Thread 3 acquires a permit
                    System.out.println("Thread 3 is doing some work.");
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work
                    semaphore.release(); // Thread 3 releases the permit
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            // Thread 4
            Thread thread4 = new Thread(() -> {
                try {
                    semaphore.acquire(); // Thread 4 tries to acquire a permit but may block
                    System.out.println("Thread 4 is doing some work.");
                    Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating work
                    semaphore.release(); // Thread 4 releases the permit
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            });

            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
            thread3.start();
            thread4.start();
        }
    }

  ```

  - `Thread 4` attempts to acquire a permit from the semaphore as well. However, since all three permits are already acquired by `Thread 1`, `Thread 2`, and `Thread 3`, `Thread 4` will be blocked until one of the permits becomes available.

  - The use of `Thread.sleep()` is used to simulate work being done in each thread.

- ### `CountDownLatch`

  A CountDownLatch is a synchronization aid in Java that allows one or more threads to wait for a set of events or conditions to occur before they can proceed. It initializes with a count, and threads can decrease the count by calling countDown(). When the count reaches zero, all waiting threads are released simultaneously, allowing them to continue their execution. This is often used to coordinate multiple threads in scenarios where they need to wait for certain initialization or processing to complete before continuing.

  ```java
    import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch;

    public class CountDownLatchExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
            int numberOfThreads = 3;
            CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(numberOfThreads);

            // Create and start three worker threads
            for (int i = 0; i < numberOfThreads; i++) {
                Thread workerThread = new Thread(() -> {
                    try {
                        System.out.println("Thread is working...");
                        Thread.sleep(2000); // Simulating some work
                        System.out.println("Thread has completed its work.");
                        latch.countDown(); // Signal that this thread has completed
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    }
                });
                workerThread.start();
            }

            // Main thread waits for all worker threads to complete
            latch.await(); // This will block until the count reaches zero

            System.out.println("All worker threads have completed their work. Main thread proceeds.");
        }
    }

  ```
