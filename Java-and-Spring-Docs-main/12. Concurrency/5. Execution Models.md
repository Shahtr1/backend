### 1. Producer-Consumer

The queue between the producers and consumers is a `bound resource`. This means producer must wait for free space in the queue before writing and consumers must wait until there is something in the queue to consume.

### 2. Readers-Writers

When you have a shared resourcetaht primarily serves a source of information for readers, but is occasionly updated by the writers, `throughput` is an issue.
Emphasizing throughput can cause `starvation` and the accumulation of stale information.

`Emphasizing throughput` in this context means trying to maximize the rate at which both reading and writing operations can be performed while maintaining correctness and fairness

The challenge is to satisfy the needs of both readers and writers to satisfy correct operation, provide reasonable throughput and avoid starvation.

A simple strategy makes writers wait until there are no readers using a resource before they can update it.

If readers keep coming in continuously, writers won't get a chance to update, causing writer "starvation."

On the other hand, if frequent readers are given priority, the overall system's speed (throughput) will be reduced.

It's a trade-off between fairness for readers and efficiency for writers.

### 3. Dining Philosophers

Picture this â€“ a group of philosophers gathered around a circular table. Each philosopher has a fork on their left. In the center, there's a delicious bowl of spaghetti. Philosophers spend their time thinking, but when they get hungry, they must pick up the forks on both sides to eat.

Here's the catch: a philosopher can't eat unless they have both forks, and if their neighbors are using one of those forks, they have to wait. After eating, they put the forks back and think again until hunger strikes.

Now, replace philosophers with threads and forks with resources. This scenario mirrors many enterprise applications where processes compete for resources. Without careful design, such systems can run into issues like deadlock, livelock, and reduced efficiency.

### Beware Dependencies Between Synchronized Methods

The Java language has the notion of synchronized, which protects and individual method.
`Avoid using more than one method on a shared object`

There will be times when you must use more than one method on a shared object. When this is the case, there are three ways to make the code correct:

Imagine you have a class called `SharedObject` with two synchronized methods: `method1` and `method2`. These methods can be accessed by multiple threads concurrently. Now, let's explore the `three` approaches to deal with this situation:

- ### 1. Client-Based Locking:

  This approach places the responsibility on the code that uses the `SharedObject`. It means the code calling these methods should be aware of the need for synchronization.

  ```java
        synchronized (sharedObject) { // You manually acquire a lock on the shared object
            sharedObject.method1();
            sharedObject.method2();
            // ... other synchronized method calls
        } // Release the lock when you're done

  ```

- ### 2. Server-Based Locking:

  Here, you modify the SharedObject class itself to provide a method that wraps the synchronized methods and handles the locking.

  ```java
    public synchronized void doAllOperations() {
        method1();
        method2();
        // ... other synchronized method calls
    }

  ```

  The client code then calls `doAllOperations()` instead of calling individual methods.

- ### 3. Adapter Server:

  In cases where you can't modify the `SharedObject` class, you create a new class (an `adapter`) that holds an instance of SharedObject and adds synchronization.

  ```java
    public class SynchronizedAdapter {
        private final SharedObject original;

        public SynchronizedAdapter(SharedObject original) {
            this.original = original;
        }

        public synchronized void synchronizedMethod1() {
            original.method1();
        }
        // ... implement other synchronized methods in a similar way
    }

  ```

  Now, you use the `SynchronizedAdapter` instead of the original `SharedObject` when you want synchronized access to its methods.

## Recommendation:

`Keep your synchronized sections as small as possible`
