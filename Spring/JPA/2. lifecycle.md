Understanding the lifecycle of a JPA entity is critical. Every entity object goes through 4 stages as it interacts with the database.

| State         | What it Means                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Transient** | A plain Java object (POJO). Not known to JPA yet. No database connection.       |
| **Managed**   | JPA is now tracking it. Any changes are auto-synced to DB inside a transaction. |
| **Detached**  | It was once managed, but now JPA isn’t tracking it anymore.                     |
| **Removed**   | Marked for deletion. Will be deleted when the transaction commits.              |

1. Transient (a.k.a. “New”)

This is just a normal Java object. You made it with new.

```java
User user = new User();
user.setName("Clay");
```

- Not connected to JPA or the database.
- It has no ID (or not a valid one).
- It won’t be saved unless you tell JPA.

2. Managed

When you persist or retrieve an entity inside a transaction, JPA starts tracking it.

```java
entityManager.persist(user);  // Now it's managed
// or
User user = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);  // Managed
```

What this means:

- If you change `user.setName("Clay Updated")`, JPA will automatically update the DB when the transaction commits.
- You don’t need to write `UPDATE` SQL — Hibernate does it for you.

3. Detached

Once the transaction ends, or the `EntityManager` is closed, the managed object becomes detached.

```java
User user = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);
entityManager.close();

user.setName("Changed");  // This change won't go to the DB!
```

- Detached = JPA has stopped watching.
- You must `merge()` it later to update it in the DB.

4. Removed

If you mark an object for deletion:

```java
entityManager.remove(user);  // Not deleted yet!
```

- It becomes removed.
- When the transaction commits → JPA will delete the row from the DB.
