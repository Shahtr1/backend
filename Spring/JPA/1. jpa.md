## What Is JPA?

- JPA = Java Persistence API
- It’s a specification — not a library — that defines how Java objects (like your `User` class) are mapped to database tables.

## What Is a **Specification** in Programming?

- A specification is just a set of rules, guidelines, or contracts that describe how something should behave — but not how it's implemented.
- Think of it as a blueprint or interface, but for an entire concept or system.

JPA = Specification

It defines:

- How to annotate entities (`@Entity`, `@Id`, etc.)
- What methods should exist (`persist()`, `merge()`, etc.)
- How the EntityManager should behave

BUT...

JPA doesn’t provide the code that runs it.

Hibernate = Implementation
Hibernate is a library that follows JPA's rules and actually does the work:

- Creates tables
- Runs SQL queries
- Tracks entities

Basic JPA Flow:

1.  You write a `@Entity` class like `User`
2.  Spring Boot (with Hibernate) creates SQL tables for it
3.  You save/fetch Java objects, and JPA handles the DB interaction

```java
@Entity
public class User {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;

    private String name;
}

```

You didn’t write any SQL — but JPA will create a `user` table with `id` and `name` columns, and let you read/write users from the DB.
