## What is `EntityManager` and How It Works?

This is the **heart of JPA**. Think of `EntityManager` as JPA’s main tool that manages your entity objects and interacts with the database under the hood.

`EntityManager` is an interface provided by JPA to:

| Action              | Description                                                             |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create              | `persist()` — saves new objects to DB                                   |
| Read                | `find()` / `createQuery()` — retrieves data                             |
| Update              | `merge()` — updates existing/detached objects                           |
| Delete              | `remove()` — deletes entities                                           |
| Manage lifecycle    | Moves entities between transient, managed, detached, and removed states |
| Handle Transactions | Participates in transactions (commits/rollbacks)                        |

### 1. What does `persist()` do?

```java
entityManager.persist(entity);
```

It takes a new (transient) Java object and makes it a managed entity. This means:

- It will be inserted into the database when the transaction is committed.
- JPA starts tracking changes to this object.
- If you change its fields later in the same transaction, JPA will automatically update the database.

- What kind of object can you pass to `persist()`?

Only a transient entity, i.e., a new object created with new, that hasn’t been persisted before and has no ID (or a non-assigned one if auto-generated).

- What happens under the hood?

  1.  JPA marks the object as managed.
  2.  No SQL is executed immediately.
  3.  When the transaction commits, JPA fires an `INSERT` statement.
  4.  If the entity has an `@GeneratedValue`, it gets the generated ID back after insert.

- What if the object has an ID already?

If the entity has a manually set ID and already exists in the DB, `persist()` will throw an exception (usually `EntityExistsException`).

| Mistake                                   | Result                      |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Calling `persist()` on an existing object | `EntityExistsException`     |
| Thinking it executes immediately          | No — it defers until commit |
| Not using a transaction                   | Nothing happens — no insert |

### 2. What does `merge()` do?

```java
EntityManager.merge(entity);
```

This method is used to:

- Reattach a detached entity (was managed before, now JPA isn’t tracking it).
- Copy data from an entity (detached or new) into a new managed instance.
- Automatically decide whether to insert or update the record in the database.

`merge()` copies the state of your given object into a new managed instance, and returns that managed instance.

```java
User detachedUser = new User(1L, "Updated Name");
User managedUser = entityManager.merge(detachedUser);
```

- `detachedUser` is still detached.
- `managedUser` is the tracked one. Only `managedUser` is watched by JPA!

| Situation                                                            | Use `merge()`?             | Why                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| You fetched an entity earlier, now want to update it after detaching | ✅ Yes                     | To reattach it                  |
| You receive a DTO from frontend with an ID                           | ✅ Yes                     | Safe way to update in DB        |
| You aren’t sure if it exists yet                                     | ✅ Yes                     | `merge()` will insert or update |
| You're creating a new entity from scratch                            | ❌ Better: use `persist()` | More efficient for new data     |

- Mistake

```java
User u1 = new User(1L, "Clay");
User u2 = entityManager.merge(u1);

u1.setName("Wrong");  // ❌ Not tracked
u2.setName("Right");  // ✅ Tracked
```

### 3. What does `remove()` do?

```java
entityManager.remove(entity);
```

This method is used to delete an entity from the database — but with a catch:

- It only works on managed entities.

- What happens when you call `remove()`?

  1.  JPA marks the entity as removed (but does not immediately execute the delete).
  2.  The actual `DELETE FROM ... SQL` happens when the transaction commits.
  3.  After that, the entity becomes detached.

```java
User user = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);  // Managed
entityManager.remove(user);  // Marked for deletion
```

At transaction commit:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1;
```

- What if you only have a detached entity?

Use `merge()` first:

```java
User detachedUser = new User(1L, "Clay");
User managedUser = entityManager.merge(detachedUser);
entityManager.remove(managedUser);  // Now it works
```

### 4. What does `find()` do?

```java
EntityManager.find(EntityClass.class, id);
```

It retrieves an entity from the database (or cache) by its primary key (ID), and returns a managed object.

- Internal Flow of find():

1.  First-level cache check (persistence context):

    - If the entity was already loaded earlier in the transaction, JPA returns the same Java object — no SQL is executed.

2.  Database query (if not in cache):

    - JPA generates and runs a SQL `SELECT` to fetch the row from the table.
    - It creates a managed object, attaches it to the persistence context, and returns it.

#### First-Level Cache: Identity Guarantee

JPA’s persistence context guarantees identity of managed entities.

```java
User user1 = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);
User user2 = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);

System.out.println(user1 == user2);  // true ✅
```

Even though you asked for it twice, you get the same Java object because JPA caches it per transaction/session.

If no row exists for that ID, `find()` returns `null`.

### 5. `flush()` and `clear()` — Manual Persistence Control

These are advanced tools for controlling how and when JPA interacts with the database.

- `flush()` — Force Sync to the Database

  - It forces JPA to immediately synchronize the persistence context with the underlying database.
  - Basically: “Write all the pending `INSERT`/`UPDATE`/`DELETE` statements to the DB now — don’t wait for commit.”

    Why would you use `flush()`?

    By default, JPA waits until:

    - The transaction commits
    - Or the persistence context is closed

    But sometimes you want the SQL to execute right now, for example:

    - When you need to read from the database after an insert
    - When you're doing batch processing and want to avoid memory buildup
    - When you want to trigger DB constraints or see DB-generated values (like `@GeneratedValue` IDs) immediately

    Important Notes on `flush()`:

    - It only sends SQL to the DB — it does not commit the transaction.
    - If you roll back the transaction later, the DB changes are undone.
    - It may expose constraint violations (e.g. unique keys) earlier.

- `clear()` — Detach All Entities

- It clears the entire persistence context — all entities currently managed become detached.
- Basically: _“Forget everything you're tracking right now.”_

  - Why would you use `clear()`?
    - Free up memory during batch processing
    - Avoid unwanted updates or memory leaks
    - Force reloading of entities from the database
    - Break identity guarantees intentionally

### 6. What is the Persistence Context?

It’s an in-memory container that JPA uses to track all the managed entities in a transaction/session.

You can think of it like a **mini-cache + tracker** inside the `EntityManager`.

Why does it exist?

- To avoid redundant DB access
- To detect changes (dirty checking)
- To ensure object identity (`==`)
- To delay SQL execution for optimization

_“JPA’s working memory of all the entities it is currently watching.”_

- Lifecycle of the Persistence Context

1.  Starts when a transaction begins or when `EntityManager` is created
2.  Ends when the transaction commits, rolls back, or `EntityManager` is closed
3.  During its life, it stores and tracks all managed entities

- What Happens Inside the Persistence Context?

Stores all managed entities

```java
User u1 = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);
User u2 = entityManager.find(User.class, 1L);
// Only one SQL SELECT happens, and:
u1 == u2;  // true ✅
```

Why? Because both are the same object from the persistence context.

- What is not in the Persistence Context?

  - Detached entities (`em.close()` or `clear()` removes them)
  - New objects that haven’t been `persist()`ed yet
  - Any entity not retrieved or saved inside the current transaction
