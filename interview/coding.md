💡 Java Code Example – Clean Retry Logic
java
Copy
Edit
public <T> T retry(Supplier<T> action, int retries) {
for (int i = 0; i <= retries; i++) {
try {
return action.get();
} catch (Exception e) {
if (i == retries) throw e;
try {
Thread.sleep((long) Math.pow(2, i) \* 100L); // exponential backoff
} catch (InterruptedException ie) {
Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
throw new RuntimeException("Retry interrupted");
}
}
}
throw new RuntimeException("Unreachable");
}
