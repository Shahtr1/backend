JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract computing machine responsible for:

- Loading Java bytecode (.class files)
- Verifying and executing the code
- Managing memory, threads, and garbage collection

We can break down the architecture into the following major subsystems:

## 1. Class Loader Subsystem

The Class Loader Subsystem is the entry point of the JVM. Its job is to load class files (.class) into memory and prepare them for execution.

Steps of Class Loading:

1. Loading:
   - Finds the .class file and reads it into memory
   - Converts it into an internal Class object
2. Linking (3 sub-steps):
   - Verification: Ensures the bytecode is safe (no illegal code)
   - Preparation: Reserves memory for static variables and sets default values
   - Resolution: Converts references (like java/lang/String) into actual memory addresses
3. Initialization:
   - Runs static blocks (static {}) and assigns actual values to static variables
4. Using:
   - Class is ready to be used by the program

There are 3 built-in class loaders, and they work in a parent-child hierarchy:
| ClassLoader | What it Loads | Location |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Bootstrap** | Core Java classes (`java.*`) | JVM's internal paths |
| **Extension** | Extension libraries (`javax.*`) | `$JAVA_HOME/lib/ext` |
| **Application/System** | Classes from your app (`com.*`) | Your project's classpath |

## 2. Execution Engine

This is the heart of the JVM — it takes the class that was loaded, verified, and prepared, and actually runs the bytecode instructions.
The execution engine is responsible for:

- Reading bytecode
- Decoding it
- Executing it instruction by instruction

### Internal Components of Execution Engine

1. Interpreter
   - Reads and executes one bytecode instruction at a time
   - Simple but slow
   - Used in the beginning for faster startup
2. JIT Compiler (Just-In-Time)
   - JVM watches which methods get called again and again (like loops or popular functions)
   - When JVM sees that a method is being used a lot, it marks it as "hot"
   - Converts hot methods (frequently used code) into native machine code at runtime
   - Native code is faster — no need to interpret again
   - Once compiled, JVM directly runs the native code version
   - Happens in the background while your app runs

- Important JIT optimizations:
  - Inlining: Replaces method calls with actual code
  - Loop unrolling: Optimizes loops for fewer jumps
  - Dead code elimination: Removes unused instructions

**`JIT` is why Java is faster than people expect — it compiles "just in time" for max speed.**

3. Garbage Collector (GC)
   Although sometimes considered separate, it works closely with the Execution Engine.

   - Automatically reclaims memory by removing unused objects from the Heap
   - Uses algorithms like:
     - Mark and Sweep
     - Generational GC
     - G1 GC, ZGC, etc.

4. Bytecode Verifier
   Before execution, the Bytecode Verifier checks:

   - Is the code safe?
   - Are variables properly typed?
   - Are memory accesses valid?

   If any bytecode is unsafe, the JVM throws a `VerifyError`.

   ```scss
   Bytecode (.class)
   ↓
   Bytecode Verifier (safe?)
   ↓
   Interpreter → Execute line-by-line
   ↓ (if hot code)
   JIT Compiler → Native code
   ↓
   Run at native machine speed

   ```

## 3. Java Native Interface (JNI)

Java Native Interface (JNI) is a bridge that allows Java code to call native code written in languages like C, C++, or even assembly.

Because some low-level operations like:

- Interacting with hardware
- Accessing OS-specific APIs
- Using legacy C/C++ libraries
  ...can't be done directly in Java.

So JNI lets Java reach outside the JVM to execute native code.

| Use Case                   | Example                                              |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| OS-specific operations     | Device drivers, file permissions                     |
| High-performance libraries | OpenCV (for image processing), TensorFlow native ops |
| Legacy system integration  | Java calling old C/C++ systems                       |
| JVM internals              | JVM itself is written in C++, uses JNI internally    |

JVMs like HotSpot (Oracle/OpenJDK), GraalVM, IBM J9, etc., are written in C/C++ — they’re compiled into native executables (java.exe, java, etc.).
So technically, they are not running inside the JVM, they are the JVM.

**So why does the JVM need JNI inside itself?**
Even though the JVM is native code, the Java standard library (Java code) still occasionally needs to call into that native part — and JNI is the official mechanism to do that.
Example: `System.currentTimeMillis()`

```java
public static native long currentTimeMillis();
```

- When your Java code calls it, the JVM looks up a native C++ function that implements it.
- This function is part of the JVM’s native codebase.
- The call is made through the JNI layer, which handles the bridge.

## 4. Native Method Libraries

This layer is closely tied to JNI, but it represents the actual binary files that contain the native code which Java methods (via JNI) invoke.
It’s a collection of compiled platform-specific native code used by the JVM when a native method is called.
Examples:

- `jvm.dll` (on Windows)
- `libjvm.so` (on Linux)
- `libjvm.dylib` (on macOS)
