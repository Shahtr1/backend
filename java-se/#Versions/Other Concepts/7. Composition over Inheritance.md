## Inheritance — Pros and Pitfalls

Inheritance means an object "**is a**" kind of another type.

**Pros:**

- Reuse behavior from a base class.
- Easier and quicker to implement small changes initially.
- Polymorphism: subclass instances can be treated as superclass types.

**Pitfalls:**

1.  Tight Coupling

    - Subclasses are tightly coupled to superclass implementation.
    - Changes in the base class can break subclasses.

2.  Fragile Hierarchies

    - Deep hierarchies become rigid and hard to understand.
    - Refactoring becomes a nightmare.

3.  Inheritance for behavior reuse = wrong motivation

    - Using inheritance just to reuse code can lead to poor abstraction.

4.  Violates Encapsulation
    - Subclasses get access to protected/internal behavior they shouldn’t touch.

## Composition — The Better Alternative

Composition means an object "**has a**" relationship with another object (usually via a field). You delegate behavior instead of inheriting it.

**Pros**

1.  Loose Coupling

    - You can change composed objects independently.
    - Promotes modular, pluggable design.

2.  Code Reuse Without Inheritance

    - Avoids fragile base class issues.
    - You can reuse behavior across unrelated classes.

3.  Greater Flexibility (Run-time)

    - Behavior can be changed at runtime via different component instances.
    - Better Adheres to SOLID Principles

## Example 1: Logger System

❌ Using Inheritance:

```java
class FileLogger {
    void log(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Logging to file: " + msg);
    }
}

class DBLogger extends FileLogger {
    // But I also want to log to DB differently...
}
```

✅ Using Composition:

```java
interface Logger{
    void log(String msg);
}

class FileLogger implements Logger {
    public void log(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Logging to file: " + msg);
    }
}

class DBLogger implements Logger {
    public void log(String msg) {
        System.out.println("Logging to DB: " + msg);
    }
}

class UserService {
    private final Logger logger;

    UserService(Logger logger) {
        this.logger = logger;
    }

    void registerUser(String user) {
        // do stuff...
        logger.log("User " + user + " registered.");
    }
}
```

At runtime:

```java
UserService service = new UserService(new FileLogger());
// Or swap to DBLogger without touching UserService code
```

Open for extension, closed for modification — classic Open/Closed Principle.

## Example 2: Game Character Abilities

Suppose you're making an RPG game.

❌ Inheritance Hierarchy:

```java
class Character {
    void attack() { ... }
}

class Warrior extends Character {
    void useSword() { ... }
}

class Archer extends Character {
    void useBow() { ... }
}

// What if a character can use both? What about magic + sword?

```

Now you’re stuck with rigid multiple inheritance issues (which Java doesn't support well).

✅ Composition with Strategy Pattern:

```java
interface AttackStrategy {
    void attack();
}

class SwordAttack implements AttackStrategy {
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Swings sword!");
    }
}

class BowAttack implements AttackStrategy {
    public void attack() {
        System.out.println("Shoots arrow!");
    }
}

class Character {
    private AttackStrategy attackStrategy;

    Character(AttackStrategy attackStrategy) {
        this.attackStrategy = attackStrategy;
    }

    void performAttack() {
        attackStrategy.attack();
    }

    void setAttackStrategy(AttackStrategy strategy) {
        this.attackStrategy = strategy;
    }
}

```

At runtime:

```java
Character warrior = new Character(new SwordAttack());
warrior.performAttack(); // Swings sword!
warrior.setAttackStrategy(new BowAttack());
warrior.performAttack(); // Shoots arrow!
```

```text
Use composition to model behavior (what an object does), "X is a kind of Y"
Use inheritance to model type hierarchy (what an object is). "X has a Y" or "X can do Y"
```
