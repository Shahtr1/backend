## What is the difference between Collections.synchronizedList() and CopyOnWriteArrayList?

| Feature               | `Collections.synchronizedList()`    | `CopyOnWriteArrayList`                  |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Thread Safety**     | ✅ Yes (external lock)              | ✅ Yes (internal copy-on-write logic)   |
| **Read Performance**  | ❌ Slower (needs lock)              | ✅ Fast (no lock for read)              |
| **Write Performance** | ✅ Faster (single copy)             | ❌ Slower (copies whole array on write) |
| **Iteration Safety**  | ❌ Fail-fast                        | ✅ Fail-safe (iterates over old copy)   |
| **Null elements**     | ✅ Allowed                          | ✅ Allowed                              |
| **Use Case**          | Moderate writes, high sync accuracy | Few writes, many reads (read-heavy)     |
