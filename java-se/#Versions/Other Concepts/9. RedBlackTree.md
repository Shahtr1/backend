A Red-Black Tree is a binary search tree with extra rules to keep it balanced:

1.  Each node is red or black
2.  Root is always black
3.  Every path from a node to null has the same number of black nodes
4.  New nodes are always inserted red
5.  The tree balances itself using rotations and recoloring.
6.  No RED parent with RED child â€” this is a violation
