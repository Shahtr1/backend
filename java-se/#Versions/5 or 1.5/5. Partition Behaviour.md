There are varioud ways to partiton behaviour in a concurrent application.

Lets learn some basic definitions first:

### 1. Bound Resources

Resources of a fixed size or number used in concurrent environment. Examples: `database connection` and `fixed-size read/write buffers`.

In this example, we'll simulate a pool of fixed-size database connections that multiple threads need to acquire and release.

```java
    import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;

    class DatabaseConnection {
        // Simulating a database connection
        // ...

        public void acquire() {
            // Acquire the connection
            // ...
        }

        public void release() {
            // Release the connection
            // ...
        }
    }

    class Application {
        private static final int MAX_CONNECTIONS = 5;
        private static Semaphore connectionPool = new Semaphore(MAX_CONNECTIONS);

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                new Thread(() -> {
                    try {
                        connectionPool.acquire();
                        // Use the database connection
                        // ...
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        e.printStackTrace();
                    } finally {
                        connectionPool.release();
                    }
                }).start();
            }
        }
    }

```

### 2. Mutual Exclusion

Only one thread can access shared data or a shared reource at a time

To achieve mutual exclusion in Java, synchronization mechanisms like the synchronized keyword and explicit locks are commonly used.

- ### Example 1: Using the synchronized Keyword

  In this example, we have a shared bank account that multiple threads are trying to deposit money into. We need to ensure that only one thread can deposit money at a time to avoid inconsistencies.

  ```java
    class BankAccount {
        private double balance;

        public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
            this.balance = initialBalance;
        }

        public synchronized void deposit(double amount) {
            balance += amount;
            System.out.println("Deposited $" + amount);
        }

        public double getBalance() {
            return balance;
        }
    }

    public class MutualExclusionExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);

            Runnable depositTask = () -> {
                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    account.deposit(100);
                }
            };

            Thread thread1 = new Thread(depositTask);
            Thread thread2 = new Thread(depositTask);

            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();

            try {
                thread1.join();
                thread2.join();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }

            System.out.println("Final Balance: $" + account.getBalance());
        }
    }

  ```

  In this example, the deposit method is declared as synchronized. When a thread calls this method, it acquires a lock on the BankAccount object, ensuring that no other thread can execute the same method simultaneously. This guarantees mutual exclusion, preventing race conditions when depositing money.

  - ### Example 2: Using Explicit Locks

    Java also provides explicit locks from the java.util.concurrent.locks package, which offer more fine-grained control over synchronization.

    In this example, we use a ReentrantLock to achieve mutual exclusion.

    ```java
        import java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock;

        class BankAccount {
            private double balance;
            private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();

            public BankAccount(double initialBalance) {
                this.balance = initialBalance;
            }

            public void deposit(double amount) {
                lock.lock();
                try {
                    balance += amount;
                    System.out.println("Deposited $" + amount);
                } finally {
                    lock.unlock();
                }
            }

            public double getBalance() {
                return balance;
            }
        }

        public class MutualExclusionExample {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                BankAccount account = new BankAccount(1000);

                Runnable depositTask = () -> {
                    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                        account.deposit(100);
                    }
                };

                Thread thread1 = new Thread(depositTask);
                Thread thread2 = new Thread(depositTask);

                thread1.start();
                thread2.start();

                try {
                    thread1.join();
                    thread2.join();
                } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }

                System.out.println("Final Balance: $" + account.getBalance());
            }
        }

    ```

    In this example, we use a ReentrantLock to explicitly lock and unlock the critical section of code in the deposit method. This provides more control over when to acquire and release the lock, allowing for advanced scenarios if needed.

### 3. Starvation

One thread or a group of threads is prohibited from proceeding for an excessively long time or forever.
For Example., always letting fast-running threads through first could starve out longer running threads if there is no end to the fast-running threads.

### 4. Deadlock

Two or more threads waiting for each other to finish. Each thread has a resource that the other thread requires and neither can finish until it gets the other resource.

```java
    class DeadlockExample {
        private static final Object resource1 = new Object();
        private static final Object resource2 = new Object();

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
                synchronized (resource1) {
                    // Thread 1 locks resource1
                    // ...

                    synchronized (resource2) {
                        // Thread 1 tries to lock resource2
                        // This may lead to a deadlock
                    }
                }
            });

            Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
                synchronized (resource2) {
                    // Thread 2 locks resource2
                    // ...

                    synchronized (resource1) {
                        // Thread 2 tries to lock resource1
                        // This may lead to a deadlock
                    }
                }
            });

            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }
    }

```

### 5. Livelock

Threads in lockstep, each trying to do work but finding another `in the way`. Due to resonance, threads continue trying to make progress but are unable to for an excessively long time.

```java
    class LivelockExample {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Object lock1 = new Object();
            Object lock2 = new Object();
            boolean flag = true;

            Thread thread1 = new Thread(() -> {
                while (flag) {
                    // Thread 1 is trying to work but keeps yielding
                    Thread.yield();
                }
            });

            Thread thread2 = new Thread(() -> {
                while (flag) {
                    // Thread 2 is trying to work but keeps yielding
                    Thread.yield();
                }
            });

            thread1.start();
            thread2.start();
        }
    }

```
