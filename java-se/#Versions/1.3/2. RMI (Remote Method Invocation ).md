## RMI

allows Java objects to communicate remotely, calling methods across a network.

## Stub Class

A stub class in `Java RMI` acts as a `client-side proxy` or `representative` for the `remote object`. When a client invokes a method on a stub object, it's actually invoking a method on a remote object.

- ## Functionality:

  - 1.  **Method Invocation**: When a method of the stub is called, the stub class takes care of:

    - Packaging the method parameters.
    - Sending the method invocation across the network to the actual remote object.

  - 2.  **Communication**: The stub communicates with the remote object's skeleton (server-side counterpart), which then invokes the method on the actual remote object.

  - 3.  **Result Handling**: After the remote method is executed, the stub receives the return value or exception, if any, and passes it back to the caller.

- ## Automatic Generation:

  In `modern Java RMI`, stub classes are generated `automatically` at runtime, eliminating the need for explicit stub code generation that was required in earlier versions of Java RMI.

- ## Example Concept:

  Suppose you have a remote interface `MyRemoteService` and its implementation `MyRemoteServiceImpl`. In a `client-server RMI setup`:

  - **Server**: Hosts the `MyRemoteServiceImpl` object.
  - **Client**: Uses a `stub` object of `MyRemoteService` to interact with the remote service

  ```java
    // Remote interface
    public interface MyRemoteService extends Remote {
        String doRemoteTask() throws RemoteException;
    }

    // Implementation of the remote interface
    public class MyRemoteServiceImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements MyRemoteService {
        public MyRemoteServiceImpl() throws RemoteException {
            super();
        }

        public String doRemoteTask() throws RemoteException {
            return "Task Completed";
        }
    }

    // On the client side
    MyRemoteService service = (MyRemoteService) Naming.lookup("rmi://server-address/RemoteService");
    String result = service.doRemoteTask(); // Invoking method on the stub

  ```

- ### Downloading Stub Classes:

  Previously, `RMI` required the client to have the `stub classes` for the remote object locally.
  `Java 1.3` introduced the ability to download these stub classes from a remote HTTP server.

  ```java
    import java.rmi.*;
    import java.rmi.server.*;
    import java.rmi.registry.*;

    public class HelloImpl extends UnicastRemoteObject implements Hello {
        public HelloImpl() throws RemoteException {
            super();
        }

        public String sayHello() throws RemoteException {
            return "Hello, world!";
        }

        public static void main(String args[]) {
            try {
                HelloImpl obj = new HelloImpl();
                Naming.rebind("//localhost/HelloServer", obj);
                System.out.println("HelloServer bound in registry");
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.out.println("HelloImpl err: " + e.getMessage());
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        }
    }

    public interface Hello extends Remote {
        String sayHello() throws RemoteException;
    }

    // This example demonstrates a simple RMI server.

    /*
    The HelloImpl class implements a remote interface Hello. The server binds the HelloImpl instance to the RMI registry.
    */

  ```
