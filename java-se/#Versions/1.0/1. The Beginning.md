## Development:

Java was developed by `James Gosling` at `Sun Microsystems` (later acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in `1995`.

## Initial Name:

Originally called `Oak`, named after an oak tree outside Gosling's office.

## Release and Context:

- ### Release Date:

  January 23, 1996

- ### Context:

  Java 1.0 was released as an early programming language designed for `interactive television`, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time.
  It found its place in the burgeoning `World Wide Web`.

## Key Features:

- ### 1. Write Once, Run Anywhere (WORA):

  Java programs are compiled into `bytecode`, which can be run on any `Java Virtual Machine (JVM)`, regardless of the underlying computer architecture.

- ### 2. AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit):

  `AWT` was `Java's first GUI` (Graphical User Interface) toolkit, allowing developers to create window-based applications.

  ```java
  import java.awt.*;

  public class MyWindow extends Frame {
      public MyWindow() {
          super("My First Window");
          setSize(300, 200);
          setVisible(true);
      }

      public static void main(String[] args) {
          new MyWindow();
      }
  }
  // This code creates a basic window using AWT.
  ```

- ### 3. Applets:

  `Applets` were small applications designed to be `embedded` within a `web browser`.

  ```java
  import java.applet.Applet;
  import java.awt.Graphics;

  public class HelloWorldApplet extends Applet {
      public void paint(Graphics g) {
          g.drawString("Hello, world!", 20, 20);
      }
  }

  // This applet would display "Hello, world!" on a web page.
  ```

- ### 4. Garbage Collection:

  Automatic `memory management`, where the system identifies and `discards objects` that are no longer in use.

- ### 5. Security:

  Java was designed with a strong emphasis on security, including the `sandbox model for applet execution`.
