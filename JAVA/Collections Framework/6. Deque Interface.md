## Overview

The `Deque` interface, short for "`Double Ended Queue`," is a linear collection that supports element insertion and removal at both ends. It extends the Queue interface.

## Characteristics:

- **Double-Ended**: Elements can be added or removed from both the front (head) and the back (tail) of the deque.

- **Null Elements**: The general contract of Deque `does not allow` the insertion of null elements.

- **Flexible**: Can be used both as a `stack` (LIFO - Last In First Out) and as a `queue` (FIFO - First In First Out).

## Core Methods:

`addFirst(E e) and offerFirst(E e)`: Inserts the element at the front of the deque.

`addLast(E e) and offerLast(E e)`: Inserts the element at the end of the deque.

`removeFirst() and pollFirst()`: Retrieves and removes the first element of the deque.

`removeLast() and pollLast()`: Retrieves and removes the last element of the deque.

`getFirst() and peekFirst()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of the deque.

`getLast() and peekLast()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of the deque.

## Implementations:

- **ArrayDeque**
  `Resizable-array` implementation of the Deque interface.
  More efficient than LinkedList when used as a stack or queue.
  Does not allow null elements.

  ```java
  Deque<String> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();

  // Using as a stack (LIFO)
  deque.push("First");   // Adds to the front
  deque.push("Second");
  System.out.println(deque.pop()); // Removes and returns "Second"

  // Using as a queue (FIFO)
  deque.offerLast("Third"); // Adds to the end
  System.out.println(deque.pollFirst()); // Removes and returns "First"

  // Peek without removing
  System.out.println(deque.peekFirst()); // "Third" without removing

  ```
