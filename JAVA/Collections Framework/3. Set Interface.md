## Overview:

The `Set` interface extends the `Collection` interface and represents a collection that contains no duplicate elements. It models the `mathematical set abstraction`.

## Characteristics:

- **No Duplicates**: Ensures that no two elements in the set are equal (as determined by the equals() method).

- **Unordered Collection**: The elements in a set do not have a defined order, and the set may or may not maintain the order of insertion.

- **Single Null Allowed**: Most implementations allow at most one null element.

## Core Methods:

`boolean add(E e)`: Adds the specified element to the set if it is not already present.

`boolean remove(Object o)`: Removes the specified element from the set if it is present.

`int size()`: Returns the number of elements in the set.

`boolean isEmpty()`: Checks if the set is empty.

`boolean contains(Object o)`: Returns true if the set contains the specified element.

## Implementations:

- **HashSet**

  - **_Description_**: `HashSet` uses a hash table for storage, ensuring no duplicates are stored. It offers `constant time performance` for basic operations (`add, remove, contains, size`), assuming the hash function disperses elements properly.

  - **_Usage Scenario:_** Best used when the order of elements is not important, and you need efficient operations for checking the `presence of an element`.

  - **_Key Characteristics_**:

  1.  Backed by `HashMap`.
  2.  Constant time performance for basic operations.
  3.  Does not maintain any order of elements.

  ```java
  Set<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();
  hashSet.add("Apple");
  hashSet.add("Banana");
  hashSet.add("Apple"); // Duplicate, not added
  System.out.println(hashSet.contains("Banana")); // true
  ```

- **LinkedHashSet**

  - **_Description_**: `LinkedHashSet` is an ordered version of HashSet that maintains a `doubly-linked list` across all elements. It offers a predictable iteration order, which is the order in which elements were inserted.

  - **_Usage Scenario_**: Use when iteration order is important, but you also need the performance characteristics of a HashSet.

  - **_Key Characteristics_**:

  1.  Maintains insertion order.
  2.  Slightly slower than HashSet for adding and querying.

  ```java
  Set<String> linkedHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();
  linkedHashSet.add("One");
  linkedHashSet.add("Two");
  linkedHashSet.add("Three"); // Maintains insertion order
  for (String element : linkedHashSet) {
      System.out.println(element); // Iterates in insertion order
  }
  ```

- **TreeSet**

  - **_Description_**: `TreeSet` is implemented based on a TreeMap (`a Red-Black tree`). It stores elements in a sorted (`ascending`) order, either by their natural ordering or by a `comparator` provided at set creation time.

  - **_Usage Scenario_**: Ideal for storing elements in a sorted manner and when you need efficient retrieval of elements.

  - **_Key Characteristics_**:

  1.  Elements are sorted using their natural ordering or by a comparator.

  2.  Offers `log(n)` time cost for basic operations.

  ```java
  Set<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
  treeSet.add("Blue");
  treeSet.add("Green");
  treeSet.add("Red");
  for (String element : treeSet) {
      System.out.println(element); // Iterates in natural (sorted) order
  }

  ```
