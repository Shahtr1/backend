## Overview:

The `Queue` interface represents a collection designed for holding elements prior to processing.
Queues typically, but not necessarily, order elements in a `FIFO (first-in-first-out)` manner.

## Characteristics:

- **FIFO Order**: The default ordering principle in queues is first-in-first-out.

- **Element Access**: Provides methods for accessing elements at the head of the queue.

- **Variability**: Some queue implementations have different ordering rules, such as priority ordering.

## Core Methods:

`boolean offer(E e)`: Inserts the specified element into the queue if it's possible to do so immediately without violating capacity restrictions.

`E poll()`: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.

`E peek()`: Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of the queue, or returns null if the queue is empty.

## Implementations:

- **1. LinkedList**

  - **_Description_**: LinkedList is a doubly-linked list implementation that can be used both as a list and a queue. It implements the Queue interface, providing FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue operations.

  - **_Usage Scenario_**: Suitable for queues where elements are frequently inserted and removed from both ends.

  - **_Key Characteristics_**:

  1.  Doubly-linked list structure.
  2.  Implements both List and Queue interfaces.
  3.  Offers `constant time` for `add` and `remove` operations.

  ```java
  Queue<String> linkedListQueue = new LinkedList<>();
  linkedListQueue.offer("Alice"); // Adds to the queue
  linkedListQueue.offer("Bob");
  System.out.println(linkedListQueue.poll()); // Removes and returns "Alice"
  System.out.println(linkedListQueue.peek()); // Returns "Bob" without removing
  ```

- **2. PriorityQueue**

  - **_Description_**: `PriorityQueue` is based on a priority heap. Elements of the priority queue are ordered according to their `natural ordering`, or by a `comparator` provided at queue construction time.

  - **_Usage Scenario_**: Ideal for tasks where elements need to be processed based on `priority rather than just FIFO`.

  - **_Key Characteristics_**:

    1.  Elements are ordered by natural ordering or by a provided Comparator.

    2.  `Does not permit null elements`.

    3.  Queue retrieval operations `poll`, `remove`, `peek`, and `element` access the element at the head of the queue.

    ```java
    Queue<Integer> priorityQueue = new PriorityQueue<>();
    priorityQueue.offer(4);
    priorityQueue.offer(2);
    priorityQueue.offer(1); // Elements are automatically ordered
    System.out.println(priorityQueue.poll()); // Removes and returns "1" (highest priority)

    ```

- **3. ArrayDeque**

  - **_Description_**:
    `ArrayDeque` is a resizable-array implementation of the `Deque interface`. It can be used as both a `last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack` and a `first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue`.

    - **_Usage Scenario_**: Best used as a more efficient stack or queue where null elements are not needed.

    - **_Key Characteristics_**:

      1.  Fast array-based implementation.
      2.  Can be used both as a stack and a queue.
      3.  Does not allow null elements.

    ```java
    Queue<String> arrayDeque = new ArrayDeque<>();
    arrayDeque.offer("First");
    arrayDeque.offer("Second");
    System.out.println(arrayDeque.poll()); // Removes and returns "First"

    ```
