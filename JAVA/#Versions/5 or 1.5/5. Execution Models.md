# Concurrency Patterns in Java

## Overview

This document provides an overview of common concurrency patterns (execution models) used in multithreaded programming to manage threads, synchronize access to shared resources, and ensure data consistency.

## Common Concurrency Patterns

### 1. [Producer-Consumer Model](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_1_producer_consumer_problem)

- **Description**: In this model, **producers** generate data and place it into a shared buffer or queue, while **consumers** take data from the buffer to process it.
- **Problem Solved**: Ensures that producers and consumers operate at different speeds without losing data or creating race conditions.
- **Use Case**: Logging systems, data pipelines, job processing queues.

### 2. [Readers-Writers Problem](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_2_readers_writers_problem)

- **Description**: In scenarios where multiple threads read from a shared resource and others write to it, this model prioritizes access control:
  - **Readers** can access the resource simultaneously.
  - **Writers** require exclusive access.
- **Problem Solved**: Prevents data corruption when multiple threads read and write to the same resource.
- **Use Case**: Database systems, caching layers, configuration management.

### 3. [Dining Philosophers Problem](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_3_dining_philosophores)

- **Description**: Models a scenario where multiple threads (philosophers) compete for shared resources (forks) to perform an action (eating). Itâ€™s a metaphor for avoiding deadlock and starvation in resource allocation.
- **Problem Solved**: Prevents deadlock and ensures fairness among threads.
- **Use Case**: Resource allocation in distributed systems, avoiding circular waits.

### 4. [Thread Pool](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_3_dining_philosophores)

- **Description**: A pool of reusable worker threads that execute tasks submitted by producers. This model reduces the overhead of thread creation and destruction.
- **Problem Solved**: Manages thread lifecycle efficiently and prevents resource exhaustion.
- **Use Case**: Web servers, database connection pools, parallel data processing.

### 5. [Barrier Pattern](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_5_barrier_pattern)

- **Description**: Ensures that multiple threads reach a common point (barrier) before any of them proceed further. Useful for coordinating multiple threads to complete tasks in phases.
- **Problem Solved**: Synchronizes threads at specific checkpoints to ensure they all proceed together.
- **Use Case**: Parallel algorithms, simulations, or collaborative work.

### 6. [Future and Promise](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_6_future_and_promises)

- **Description**: Allows a thread to perform asynchronous computations and retrieve results in the future once they are available.
- **Problem Solved**: Simplifies handling asynchronous operations and callbacks.
- **Use Case**: Asynchronous I/O, parallel computation, non-blocking HTTP requests.

### 7. [Pipelining Pattern](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_7_pipelining_pattern)

- **Description**: Tasks are split into multiple stages, where each stage processes data and passes it to the next. Each stage runs in its own thread.
- **Problem Solved**: Increases throughput by parallelizing different stages of a task.
- **Use Case**: Image processing pipelines, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

### 8. [Scheduler Pattern](https://github.com/Shahtr1/Data-Structures-and-Algorithms/tree/main/java/_9_Threads/_4_execution_models/_8_scheduler_pattern)

- **Description**: Manages how and when threads are scheduled to run, usually based on priorities, deadlines, or fairness policies.
- **Problem Solved**: Ensures optimal utilization of CPU and system resources.
- **Use Case**: Task scheduling, periodic data backups, automated reports.

## Conclusion

The patterns described above are fundamental to building efficient, scalable, and reliable multi-threaded applications. By applying the right pattern based on the problem at hand, you can ensure thread synchronization, improve performance, and avoid common pitfalls such as deadlock and race conditions.
