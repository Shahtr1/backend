## What Is the Purpose of @Retention?

`@Retention` controls how long an annotation stays alive in your program — and who can access it.

Without @Retention, annotations may not even exist beyond the .java file.

Think of an Annotation as Metadata

```java
@Loggable
public void processData() {}
```

"Where should this @Loggable annotation be preserved?"

| Retention Type | Kept in Source File? | In .class File? | Available at Runtime? | Stored in Metaspace? |
| -------------- | -------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | -------------------- |
| `SOURCE`       | ✅ Yes               | ❌ No           | ❌ No                 | ❌ No                |
| `CLASS`        | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes          | ❌ No                 | ❌ No                |
| `RUNTIME`      | ✅ Yes               | ✅ Yes          | ✅ Yes                | ✅ Yes               |

- `SOURCE`: It’s like a Post-It Note that’s visible only while you’re coding. It’s thrown away when you compile.
- `CLASS`: It’s like a stamp on the file — the compiler sees it, and it’s stored in the .class, but the JVM ignores it at runtime.
- `RUNTIME`: It’s like a label the JVM keeps attached in memory. It’s still there while the program is running, and can be read by code using reflection.

```java
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Loggable {}
```

Usage:

```java
public class Service {
    @Loggable
    public void calculate() {}
}
```

Access it with reflection:

```java
Method method = Service.class.getMethod("calculate");
if (method.isAnnotationPresent(Loggable.class)) {
    System.out.println("This method should be logged!");
}
```

Annotations like `@Override` use `@Retention(SOURCE)` because the compiler uses them, and they don’t need to exist at runtime

| Use Case                                                     | Use Which Retention?  |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| For **compiler checks only**                                 | `@Retention(SOURCE)`  |
| For **bytecode processing** (e.g., ProGuard)                 | `@Retention(CLASS)`   |
| For **runtime behavior** via reflection, Spring, JUnit, etc. | `@Retention(RUNTIME)` |
