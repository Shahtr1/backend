- Memory management
- Class internals (how String is built)
- Performance optimizations
- Comparison with StringBuilder
- Design trade-offs

```java
public final class String implements java.io.Serializable, Comparable<String>, CharSequence {
    private final char value[]; // the internal char array
    private final int hash;     // cached hashCode
}
```

Key Points:

- `final class` → You cannot extend String
- `private final char[] value` → The actual characters are stored in a private final array
- `final fields` → Once constructed, they can’t be modified

### No Mutation = Consistency

```java
String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = s1;
```

If String were mutable and you did:

```java
s1.setCharAt(0, 'H'); // Hypothetical mutable version
```

Then `s2` would become `"Hava"` — even though you only changed `s1`.

### STRING INTERN POOL (String Table)

Java maintains a pool of unique string literals in a special memory area called the String Intern Pool:

```java
String a = "Hello";
String b = "Hello";
System.out.println(a == b); // true, same reference!
```

Because `String` is immutable, Java guarantees that `"Hello"` can be reused safely anywhere in the program. This saves memory and allows fast comparisons using `==`.

### HASHCODE CACHING

You’ve probably seen that `String` overrides `hashCode()`:

```java
public int hashCode() {
    int h = hash;
    if (h == 0 && value.length > 0) {
        for (char c : value)
            h = 31 * h + c;
        hash = h;
    }
    return h;
}
```

### THREAD SAFETY WITHOUT SYNCHRONIZATION

Immutable objects are naturally safe to share between threads because:

- No one can change the internal state
- No need for locks, copies, or defensive programming

Compare this with StringBuilder, which is mutable and not thread-safe

### PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION: Copy-on-Write Semantics

Since `String` is immutable, operations like `.substring()` in Java 6 and earlier used to share the underlying array — clever optimization:

part would not allocate new memory, just reference a different portion of the same char[].

But this had side effects (memory leaks), so in Java 7+, substring() copies the array again — still, the immutability made such tricks possible.
