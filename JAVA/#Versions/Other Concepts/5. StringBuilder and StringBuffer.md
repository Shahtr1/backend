## `StringBuilder` vs `StringBuffer` in Java

Both are used for mutable sequences of characters — unlike `String`, which is **immutable**.

| Feature           | `StringBuilder`                 | `StringBuffer`                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Thread Safety** | ❌ Not thread-safe              | ✅ Thread-safe (synchronized)   |
| **Performance**   | ✅ Faster (no overhead of sync) | ❌ Slower (due to sync methods) |
| **Use Case**      | Single-threaded environments    | Multi-threaded environments     |
| **Introduced In** | Java 5                          | Java 1.0                        |

In `StringBuffer`, methods like `.append()`, `.insert()`, `.delete()` are synchronized, making it safe for concurrent use — but slower.
