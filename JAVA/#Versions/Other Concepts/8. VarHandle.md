## What is an Atomic Operation?

An atomic operation is one that:

- Cannot be interrupted
- Always completes entirely or not at all
- Is thread-safe by default

Imagine two threads trying to write to the same memory slot.
Atomic operations ensure that only one wins ‚Äî without using a lock.

## What is a VarHandle?

Think of `VarHandle` like a pointer with superpowers:
It lets you read, write, and do atomic operations on a field or array element.

It‚Äôs the safe, modern alternative to `sun.misc.Unsafe`.

Java‚Äôs `ConcurrentHashMap` uses atomic memory operations to avoid locking when possible ‚Äî for example, when inserting into an empty bucket.

Suppose you have:

```java
Node<K, V>[] table = new Node[16];
```

You want to atomically insert at table[5], but only if it is still null.
With VarHandle, you can say:

```java
if (TABLE_HANDLE.compareAndSet(table, 5, null, newNode)) {
    // Successfully inserted
}
```

This works just like:

```java
if (table[5] == null) {
    table[5] = newNode;
}
```

## What Really Happens in compareAndSet(...)?

**‚ÄúCheck if table[index] == null, and if true, set it to newNode ‚Äî all in one atomic CPU instruction.‚Äù**

This whole check + update happens in one indivisible operation, thanks to CPU-level atomic instructions like `cmpxchg` (on x86 processors).

How It Works Without a Lock
Let‚Äôs say you have two threads:

üßµ Thread A:

- Sees `table[5] == null`
- Attempts to set it to `NodeA` using `compareAndSet(...)`

üßµ Thread B (at the same time):

- Also sees `table[5] == null`
- Tries to set it to `NodeB` using `compareAndSet(...)`

Here‚Äôs what the JVM does internally:

- Only one of the threads wins the race at the CPU level
- The losing thread sees the value has changed (no longer `null`)
- So its `compareAndSet` returns `false`
- The losing thread falls back to a `synchronized` block (your fallback logic)
