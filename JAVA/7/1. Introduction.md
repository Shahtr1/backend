## Release Date: `July 28, 2011`

## Key Features:

## 1. Project Coin (Small Language Enhancements):

- **Binary Literals**: Support for binary number representation.

  ```java
  int binary = 0b0101; // Represents the number 5
  ```

- **Underscores in Numeric Literals**: Improving readability of large numbers.

  ```java
  long creditCardNumber = 1234_5678_9012_3456L;
  ```

- **Strings in `Switch` Statements**: Allowing String objects in switch statements.

  ```java
    String day = "MONDAY";
    switch (day) {
        case "MONDAY":
            // ...
            break;
        // ...
    }

  ```

- **Type Inference for Generic Instance Creation (Diamond Operator)**: Simplifying instantiation of generic classes.

  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```

- **Try-with-resources Statement**: Automatic resource management for `Closeable` resources.

  ```java
  try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
      // ...
  }

  ```

- **Catching Multiple Exception Types**: Simplifying catch blocks.

  ```java
  try {
      // ...
  } catch (IOException | SQLException ex) {
      // Handle both exceptions
  }

  ```

## 2. Fork/Join Framework:

A framework designed for parallel execution of tasks, particularly useful for multicore processors.

```java
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
Long result = pool.invoke(new MyRecursiveTask(data));
```

## 3. New File I/O (NIO.2):

Enhanced file I/O capabilities with the introduction of the `java.nio.file` package, offering improved functionality for file handling and manipulation.

```java
Path path = Paths.get("example.txt");
List<String> lines = Files.readAllLines(path, StandardCharsets.UTF_8);

```

## 4. Enhanced Concurrency Utilities:

Additional concurrency utilities in the `java.util.concurrent` package, such as the `Phaser` class and `TransferQueue` interface.

## 5. Enhanced Security:

Upgraded security features and algorithms, including `elliptic-curve cryptography (ECC)`.

## 6. JVM Support for Dynamic Languages:

Introduction of the `invokedynamic` bytecode instruction, improving the performance of dynamic languages on the JVM.

## 7. Garbage-First Collector (G1):

A new garbage collector designed for `large heap sizes` and `predictable` garbage collection `pauses`.
