## Equals and Hashcode method

### The `.equals()` Method

By default, the Object class defines both the .equals() and .hashCode() methods. As a result, every Java class implicitly has these two methods.:

```java
class Money {
    int amount;
    String currencyCode;
}
```

```java
Money income = new Money(55, "USD");
Money expenses = new Money(55, "USD");
boolean balanced = income.equals(expenses)
```

We would expect `income.equals(expenses)` to return `true`, but with the current implementation of the `Money` class, `it won’t`

The default implementation of equals() in the Object class compares the `identity` of the object.
To change this behavior we must override this method.

```java
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == this)
        return true;
    if (!(o instanceof Money))
        return false;
    Money other = (Money)o;
    boolean currencyCodeEquals = (this.currencyCode == null && other.currencyCode == null)
      || (this.currencyCode != null && this.currencyCode.equals(other.currencyCode));
    return this.amount == other.amount && currencyCodeEquals;
}
```

### The .equals() `Contract`

`Java SE` defines the contract that our implementation of the equals() method must fulfill.

It must be:

1.  `reflexive`: an object must equal itself
2.  `symmetric`: x.equals(y) must return the same result as y.equals(x)
3.  `transitive`: if x.equals(y) and y.equals(z), then also x.equals(z)
4.  `consistent`: the value of .equals() should change only if a property that is contained in .equals() changes (no randomness allowed)

### `Violating` equals() Symmetry With `Inheritance`

Violations of the .equals() contract are more likely to occur when we extend a class that has overridden the .equals() method as well
Let’s consider a Voucher class that extends our Money class:

```java
class WrongVoucher extends Money {

    private String store;

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == this)
            return true;
        if (!(o instanceof WrongVoucher))
            return false;
        WrongVoucher other = (WrongVoucher)o;
        boolean currencyCodeEquals = (this.currencyCode == null && other.currencyCode == null)
          || (this.currencyCode != null && this.currencyCode.equals(other.currencyCode));
        boolean storeEquals = (this.store == null && other.store == null)
          || (this.store != null && this.store.equals(other.store));
        return this.amount == other.amount && currencyCodeEquals && storeEquals;
    }

    // other methods
}
```

At first glance, the `Voucher` class and its override for .equals() seem to be `correct`. Both .equals() methods behave correctly as long as we compare `Money to Money` or `Voucher to Voucher`. But what happens if we compare these `two objects`:

```java
Money cash = new Money(42, "USD");
WrongVoucher voucher = new WrongVoucher(42, "USD", "Amazon");

voucher.equals(cash) => false // As expected.
cash.equals(voucher) => true // That's wrong.
```

### `Fixing` equals() Symmetry With `Composition`

To avoid making mistakes, we should `favor` `composition over inheritance`.
Instead of subclassing Money, let’s create a Voucher class with a Money property:

```java
class Voucher {

    private Money value;
    private String store;

    Voucher(int amount, String currencyCode, String store) {
        this.value = new Money(amount, currencyCode);
        this.store = store;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (o == this)
            return true;
        if (!(o instanceof Voucher))
            return false;
        Voucher other = (Voucher) o;
        boolean valueEquals = (this.value == null && other.value == null)
          || (this.value != null && this.value.equals(other.value));
        boolean storeEquals = (this.store == null && other.store == null)
          || (this.store != null && this.store.equals(other.store));
        return valueEquals && storeEquals;
    }

    // other methods
}
```

Now .equals() will work symmetrically as the contract requires.

### The `.hashCode()` Method

The .hashCode() method returns an integer representing the `current instance of the class`.
We should calculate this value consistently with the class definition of equality.

### The .hashCode() `Contract`

Java SE also defines a contract for the .hashCode() method.

1.  `internal consistency`: the value of hashCode() may only change if a property that is in equals() changes
2.  `equals consistency`: objects that are equal to each other must return the same hashCode
3.  `collisions`: unequal objects may have the same hashCode

### `Violating` the `Consistency` of hashCode() and equals()

If we `override` equals(), we must also override hashCode().

```java
class Team {

    String city;
    String department;

    @Override
    public final boolean equals(Object o) {
        // implementation
    }
}
```

Now, if we create two Team objects, both with city “New York” and department “marketing,” they will be equal, but they’ll return different hashCodes.

### HashMap Key With an `Inconsistent` hashCode()

The `trouble` starts when some hash-based collections are involved. Let’s try to use our Team class as a key of a HashMap:

```java
Map<Team,String> leaders = new HashMap<>();
leaders.put(new Team("New York", "development"), "Anne");
leaders.put(new Team("Boston", "development"), "Brian");
leaders.put(new Team("Boston", "marketing"), "Charlie");

Team myTeam = new Team("New York", "development");
String myTeamLeader = leaders.get(myTeam);
```

We would expect myTeamLeader to return `“Anne”` but with the current code, it doesn’t.
If we want to use instances of the Team class as HashMap keys, we have to `override` the hashCode() method so that it adheres to the `contract`; `equal objects return the same hashCode`

```java
@Override
public final int hashCode() {
    int result = 17;
    if (city != null) {
        result = 31 * result + city.hashCode();
    }
    if (department != null) {
        result = 31 * result + department.hashCode();
    }
    return result;
}
```

### `When` Do We `Override` .equals() and .hashCode()?

Generally, we want to override either both .equals() and .hashCode() or neither of them.
