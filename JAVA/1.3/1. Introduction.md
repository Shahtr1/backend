## Release Date: `May 8, 2000`

`Java 1.3`, also known as `Java 2, version 1.3`, focused more on consolidating the existing features and improving performance and stability rather than introducing many new language features.

## Key Features:

- ### HotSpot JVM:

  HotSpot is a `core component of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)` that uses advanced techniques like `Just-In-Time (JIT)` compilation and `adaptive optimization` to improve application performance.

- ### Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI):

  `JNDI` was integrated into the standard library, providing a unified interface to multiple naming and directory services, `such as LDAP, DNS, and NIS`.

- ### JavaSound:

  `JavaSound API` was added, offering features for simple audio playback, capture, and processing.

- ### RMI (Remote Method Invocation) Enhancements:

  RMI was enhanced with new features, including the ability to `download stub classes` from a `remote HTTP server`, rather than requiring them to be pre-installed on the client.

- ### Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA):

  JPDA improved the debugging of Java applications, providing a more robust and flexible framework for debugging.

- ### Synthetic Proxy Classes:

  Introduction of synthetic proxy classes in reflection, allowing for dynamic creation of classes that implement specified interfaces at runtime.

- ### Other Improvements:

  - Improvements in Java 2D, including better performance and quality of graphics rendering.

  - Enhanced support for CORBA, allowing Java applications to interact with CORBA objects and services
