## Release Date: `September 17, 2019`

## Key Features:

1.  ## Text Blocks (Preview):

    Introduced to simplify the task of writing multiline string literals in Java.

    ```java
    String json = """
              {
                  "name": "John Doe",
                  "age": 30
              }
              """;

    ```

2.  ## Switch Expressions (Second Preview):

    It allowed switch to be used more flexibly as an `expression`, not just as a statement.

    ```java
    int day = switch (name) {
        case "Monday" -> 1;
        case "Tuesday" -> 2;
        default -> 0;
    };

    ```

3.  ## `ZGC`: Uncommit Unused Memory:

    Improved the Z Garbage Collector to return unused memory to the operating system more promptly, enhancing the efficiency of memory usage in large applications.
