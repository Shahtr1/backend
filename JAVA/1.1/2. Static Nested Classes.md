These do not have access to the instance variables and methods of the outer class. They are static, meaning they can be instantiated without an instance of the outer class and can only access the static members of the outer class.

```java
public class OuterClass {
    private static String staticData = "Static data in OuterClass";

    // Static nested class
    static class StaticNestedClass {
        void display() {
            // Can access the outer class's static variables
            System.out.println(staticData);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StaticNestedClass nested = new StaticNestedClass();
        nested.display();
    }
}

```
