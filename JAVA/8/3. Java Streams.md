## What are Java Streams?

Stream is a typed interface.

## Overview

The Stream API in Java allows for declarative processing of collections of data. It provides a high-level abstraction for Java Collections by performing operations in a functional-style.

## Characteristics of Streams

- **Not a data structure:** Streams don't hold or modify data, they operate on the source.
- **Lazy Invocation:** Stream operations are invoked only when necessary.
- **Possibility for parallel execution:** Streams can be processed in parallel to leverage multi-core architectures.

## Stream Operations

Stream operations are divided into intermediate (lazy) and terminal (eager) operations.

### Intermediate Operations

They are lazy and return a new stream. They include:

- `filter`: Returns a stream with elements that match a given predicate.
- `map`: Transforms elements using a provided function.
- `peek`: Performs an action on each element as they are consumed from the stream without modifying them.

Example:

```java
List<String> collected = Stream.of("apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi", "orange")
                               .filter(s -> s.contains("a"))
                               .peek(System.out::println) // this will print each element that passes the filter
                               .map(String::toUpperCase)
                               .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

### Terminal Operations

They are eager and close the stream. They include:

- **forEach**: Performs an action for each element of the stream.
- **collect**: Transforms the stream into a different form such as a List, Set, or Map.
- **reduce**: Performs a reduction on the elements of the stream with the given function.
- **count**: Returns the count of elements in the stream.

```java
long count = Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                   .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
                   .count(); // This will return 2

```

### Specialized Reductions

These are terminal operations that return a specific type of result.

- **max/min**: Return the maximum/minimum element of the stream according to a given comparator.
- **anyMatch**, **allMatch**, **noneMatch**: Return a boolean based on whether any, all, or no elements match a given predicate.

```java
OptionalInt maxVal = IntStream.of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                              .max(); // This will return an OptionalInt describing the maximum value, 5

boolean allEven = IntStream.of(2, 4, 6)
                           .allMatch(n -> n % 2 == 0); // This will return true

```

### Collectors

Collectors are used in conjunction with collect terminal operation to accumulate elements into a summary result.

```java
List<String> list = Stream.of("apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi", "orange")
                          .collect(Collectors.toList()); // This collects elements into a List

```

### Lazy Invocation

Stream operations do not run until they are needed. This is termed as "`lazy`" behavior.

```java
List<String> list = Stream.of("apple", "banana", "pear", "kiwi", "orange")
                          .filter(s -> {
                              System.out.println("Filter: " + s);
                              return s.contains("a");
                          })
                          .map(s -> {
                              System.out.println("Map: " + s);
                              return s.toUpperCase();
                          })
                          .collect(Collectors.toList());

```

In the above example, `println` statements will not execute until the `collect method` is `invoked`.
