## Release Date: `September 25, 2018`

Java 11 is a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, which means it receives updates and support for a longer period.

## Key Features:

1.  ## Standard HTTP Client (JEP 321):

    The `HTTP Client` API, introduced in Java 9 as an incubator module, was standardized and `moved` to the `java.net.http` package. It supports HTTP/2 and WebSocket.

    ```java
    HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();
    HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()
    .uri(URI.create("http://example.com"))
    .build();
    HttpResponse<String> response = client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofString());
    System.out.println(response.body());
    ```

2.  ## New String Methods:

    Added new methods to the String class for convenience, such as `isBlank()`, `lines()`, `strip()`, `stripLeading()`, `stripTrailing()`, and `repeat()`.

    ```java
    "  \n\t Java 11 \t\n".strip(); // "Java 11"
    "Java".repeat(3); // "JavaJavaJava"
    "A\nB\nC".lines().forEach(System.out::println); // A B C
    ```

3.  ## Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters (JEP 323):

    Extended the use of the `var` keyword to `lambda expressions`, allowing for the consistent use of local variable type inference in lambda parameters.

    ```java
    (var s1, var s2) -> s1 + s2
    ```

4.  ## Running Java Files Directly:

    Enhanced the java launcher to run a single-file source-code program directly, simplifying the execution of small programs or scripts.

    ```java
    java HelloWorld.java
    ```

5.  ## Removed Features and APIs:

    The `Java EE` and `CORBA` modules were removed `from` the `Java SE Platform` and the `JDK`.
    The `Nashorn JavaScript engine` and the `Pack200 tools` and API were `deprecated` for removal.

6.  ## ZGC: A Scalable Low-Latency Garbage Collector (Experimental)
