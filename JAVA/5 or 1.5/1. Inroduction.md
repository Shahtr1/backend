## Release Date: `September 30, 2004`

## Key Features:

## 1. Generics:

Generics were introduced to provide `compile-time type safety` for collections and other data structures.

```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add("Hello");
String s = list.get(0); // No need for casting

```

## 2. Enhanced for Loop (for-each Loop):

Simplified the way to iterate over collections and arrays.

```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("One", "Two", "Three");
for (String item : list) {
    System.out.println(item);
}

```

## 3. Autoboxing and Unboxing:

Automatic conversion between `primitive types `(like int, double) and their corresponding `wrapper` classes (Integer, Double).

```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
list.add(3); // Autoboxing of int to Integer
int n = list.get(0); // Unboxing of Integer to int

```

## 4. Metadata Annotations:

Introduction of metadata annotations, allowing developers to include additional information in their code, which can be processed by the compiler or used at runtime.

```java
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "Example of @Override annotation";
}

```

## 5. Enums:

Inherit from Java Enum class
can have members, fields, methods, constructors

We can pass initial state to the constructor

`Strongly-typed`, fixed set of constants (`better than` traditional `final static fields`).

```java
public enum Day {
    MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY, SUNDAY
}

public enum Flight{
    FA,
    CO,
    PA("Shahrukh");
    private String title;
    private Flight(String title){
        this.title = title;
    }
}

```

## 6. Varargs:

Support for methods that accept a variable number of arguments.

```java
public void printNumbers(int... numbers) {
    for (int number : numbers) {
        System.out.println(number);
    }
}

```

## 7. Concurrency Utilities:

The `java.util.concurrent` package, providing a set of high-level concurrency utilities like `executors`, `concurrent collections`, and `synchronizers`.

## 8. `Scanner`:

Introduction of the `Scanner` class for easier text parsing.
