# Java Generics

## Overview

Generics in Java enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. This provides a way for you to reuse the same code with different inputs. The term "`generics`" means parameterized types.

## Benefits of Generics

- **Type Safety:** Generics make errors easier to detect at compile time, rather than at runtime.
- **Elimination of Casts:** The use of generics eliminates the need for casting when retrieving elements from a collection.
- **Enforcing Type Constraints:** You can restrict the kinds of types that can be used as arguments for a parameterized type.

## Concepts in Generics

### Type Parameters

Generics in Java use type parameters, which are typically denoted by single uppercase letters. The most commonly used type parameter names are:

- `E` - Element (used extensively by the Java Collections Framework)
- `K` - Key
- `N` - Number
- `T` - Type
- `V` - Value

### Bounded Type Parameters

You can limit the types that can be used as type parameters. For example:

- `T extends Comparable<T>` restricts to Comparable types.

### Wildcards

- `? extends T`: Upper bounded wildcard, where T is any subtype of T.
- `? super T`: Lower bounded wildcard, where T is any supertype of T.
- `?`: Unbounded wildcard, stands for any type.

### Covariance and Contravariance

- **Covariance** allows you to use a subtype where a supertype is expected. If A is a subtype of B (meaning A extends B or implements B if B is an interface), then a collection of A can be treated as a collection of B.

  **Error**

  ```java
  List<Apple> apples = new ArrayList<>();
  List<Fruit> fruits = apples; // Compile error: Incompatible types
  ```

  **Fixed**

  ```java
  List<Apple> apples = new ArrayList<>();
  List<? extends Fruit> fruits = apples; // This is okay
  ```

- **Contravariance** is the opposite: it allows you to use a supertype where a subtype is expected. If A is a subtype of B, then a collection of B can be treated as if it were a collection of A.

  **Error**

  ```java
  List<Fruit> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
  List<Apple> apples = fruits; // Compile error: Incompatible types
  ```

  **Fixed**

  ```java
  List<Fruit> fruits = new ArrayList<>();
  List<? super Apple> apples = fruits; // This is okay
  ```

### Generics and Arrays

In Java, arrays are covariant, which means that an array of a subclass can be assigned to an array reference of a superclass.

## Examples

```java
// Example of a generic method
public static <T extends Comparable<T>> T maximum(T x, T y, T z) {
    T max = x;
    if (y.compareTo(max) > 0) {
        max = y;
    }
    if (z.compareTo(max) > 0) {
        max = z;
    }
    return max;
}

// Example of bounded type with wildcards
public void processElements(List<? extends SuperClass> elements) {
    for (SuperClass s : elements) {
        // Process elements
    }
}

// Example of using generics with collections
List<String> strings = new ArrayList<>();
strings.add("Hello");
String s = strings.get(0); // No cast needed
```

### Type Erasure

Generics were introduced to provide compile-time type checking and eliminate the need for casts. However, due to type erasure, the generic type information is not available at runtime.

### Reflection and Generics

Reflection can be used to inspect classes, interfaces, fields, and methods at runtime, regardless of the use of generics.

### Best Practices

Use generics whenever possible to ensure type safety.
Avoid using raw types in new code.
Consider using bounded wildcards to provide greater API flexibility.
