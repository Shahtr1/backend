## What Is a Race Condition?

A race condition occurs when two or more threads access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the timing of their execution.

It leads to unpredictable behavior and data corruption when threads interleave incorrectly.

Itâ€™s about threads modifying shared state without proper synchronization.

```java
int count = 0;

void increment() {
    count++;
}

```

Fix-1

```java
synchronized void increment() {
    count++;  // only one thread at a time
}

```

Fix-2

```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger();
count.incrementAndGet();
```
