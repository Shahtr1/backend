## 1. Status Flags or Signals

Used for simple communication between threads.

```java
public class FlagExample {
    private static volatile boolean running = true;

    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        Thread thread = new Thread(() -> {
            while (running) {
                // do something
            }
            System.out.println("Thread stopped.");
        });

        thread.start();

        Thread.sleep(1000);
        running = false;  // safely stops the thread
    }
}
// Why volatile is needed: Without it, running might be cached by the thread and the loop may never exit
```

## 2. Double-Checked Locking for Singleton

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static volatile Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {                // First check (no locking)
            synchronized (Singleton.class) {
                if (instance == null) {        // Second check (with lock)
                    instance = new Singleton();
                }
            }
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

Imagine
You have a heavyweight singleton — like a configuration loader, a database connection pool, or a logging service — that needs to be initialized once and used by many threads in a multi-threaded application.

❌ Simple synchronized version (inefficient):

```java
public static synchronized Singleton getInstance() {
    if (instance == null) {
        instance = new Singleton();
    }
    return instance;
}
```

- Thread-safe, but synchronizes every single time you call getInstance().
- This becomes a bottleneck when many threads are calling it, even after instance is already created.

## 3. Producer-Consumer Signaling

```java
public class ProducerConsumer {
    private static volatile int data = 0;
    private static volatile boolean ready = false;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread writer = new Thread(() -> {
            data = 42;
            ready = true;
        });

        Thread reader = new Thread(() -> {
            while (!ready) {
                // busy wait
            }
            System.out.println("Data: " + data);
        });

        writer.start();
        reader.start();
    }
}
```

## Limitations of volatile

- It cannot make compound actions (like i++ or check-then-act) thread-safe.
- Doesn’t provide mutual exclusion like synchronized.

1.  Non-Atomic Example (even with volatile):

```java
volatile int counter = 0;

public void increment() {
    counter++;  // NOT atomic!
}
```

This counter++ looks simple but it actually does 3 steps:

1.  Read the current value of counter
2.  Add 1 to it
3.  Write it back

Atomic Example:

```java
AtomicInteger counter = new AtomicInteger(0);

public void increment() {
    counter.incrementAndGet(); // atomic: done in one step, thread-safe
}
```

The AtomicInteger uses low-level CPU instructions to make sure no other thread can interfere.
