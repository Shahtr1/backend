## What is Metaspace?

Metaspace is the memory area used by the JVM to store class metadata.
It replaced PermGen in Java 8.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1_000_000; i++) {
            MyClass obj = new MyClass();
            obj.sayHello();
        }
    }
}

class MyClass {
    public void sayHello() {
        System.out.println("Hello");
    }
}

```

- JVM loads HelloWorld and MyClass once
- Metadata for both classes goes into Metaspace
- Even though 1 million objects are created, they go into the heap
- Only 2 classes are loaded → very little Metaspace usage

**Creating new objects doesn’t grow Metaspace — only loading new classes does.**

### Metaspace Leak — Dynamic Class Loading

Now let’s simulate a class loader memory leak, which is a classic cause of` OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace`.

```java
public class LeakyLoader {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        while (true) {
            CustomClassLoader loader = new CustomClassLoader();
            Class<?> clazz = loader.loadClass("LeakyClass");
            Object instance = clazz.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
            // Optional: call a method on the class to simulate usage
        }
    }
}

class CustomClassLoader extends ClassLoader {
    @Override
    protected Class<?> findClass(String name) throws ClassNotFoundException {
        try {
            byte[] b = Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("LeakyClass.class"));
            return defineClass(name, b, 0, b.length);
        } catch (IOException e) {
            throw new ClassNotFoundException(name);
        }
    }
}

public class LeakyClass {
    public void hello() {
        System.out.println("Leaking...");
    }
}

```

- Every iteration creates a new ClassLoader
- That ClassLoader loads a new instance of LeakyClass
- JVM stores the class metadata for each loaded class in Metaspace
- The class loader is never eligible for GC (since it’s strongly referenced by the thread stack)
- Metaspace keeps growing...

Eventually:

```cpp
Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Metaspace
```

### Class Unloading — When Does Metaspace Shrink?

Java can unload classes, but only when:

- The class loader is no longer referenced
- All classes loaded by it are also unreachable
- JVM performs a GC cycle and decides to unload

### What Class Metadata Does Metaspace Store?

When a class is loaded, the JVM stores everything it needs to understand, verify, and execute that class. This includes:

1. Class Structure & Identity
   | Metadata | Example |
   | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
   | Fully-qualified class name | `com.clay.ExampleClass` |
   | Superclass reference | `java.lang.Object` |
   | Interfaces implemented | `Serializable`, `Runnable` |
   | Modifiers | `public`, `abstract`, `final` |
   | Class version | Bytecode version (e.g., 52 for Java 8) |

2. Fields Metadata

For each field:

- Name
- Type (int, String, List<T>)
- Modifiers (private, static, final)
- Memory layout index (for fast field access)

3. Methods Metadata

Each method’s:

- Name (run, main, toString)
- Parameter types and return type
- Access modifiers (public, private, static)
- Bytecode instructions (if not native)
- Exception declarations (throws IOException)
- Stack size and local variable count
- Method table index (vtable)

4. Static Fields' Values

All static variables live in Metaspace, not on the heap (unless they point to heap objects).

```java
static int version = 1;    // primitive value lives in Metaspace
static User user = new User(); // reference is in Metaspace, object is in Heap
```

5. Constant Pool

Each class has a runtime constant pool, which contains:

- String literals
- Class names, method names, field names
- Numeric constants (42, 3.14)
- Symbolic references to other classes/methods

6. Method Tables (vtable / itable)

To support dynamic dispatch (method overriding at runtime), the JVM uses:

- vtable (virtual method table) for non-interface methods
- itable (interface table) for interface method resolution

Metaspace stores:

- Pointers to actual compiled method addresses
- Offsets per class for fast access at runtime

7. Annotations

- Runtime-visible annotations are stored in Metaspace
- Used for frameworks like Spring, JUnit, Jakarta EE, etc.

If an annotation has `@Retention(RUNTIME)`, it stays in Metaspace so Java reflection or frameworks can access it.

8. Generic Type Info (Type Erasure)
   Even though Java uses type erasure, the raw generic type info is preserved in Metaspace for:

- Reflection
- Debugging
- Tools like Lombok or Gson

The raw type info for List and ArrayList is stored in Metaspace, not the actual type parameters.

### `vtable`, `itable`, and how type info is stored in Metaspace

These concepts are how the JVM performs dynamic method dispatch — that is, calling the right method at runtime when polymorphism is involved.

| Concept    | Used For                                  | Applies To |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| **vtable** | Virtual method dispatch (class hierarchy) | Classes    |
| **itable** | Interface method dispatch                 | Interfaces |

They are part of the method dispatch structure stored in Metaspace, specifically under each class’s Class Metadata section.

#### What is vtable?

vtable = "virtual method table"
It is a table stored per class (in Metaspace) that contains:

- The actual memory addresses of methods the class can call
- One entry per method that is inherited or overridden

When you call a method on a reference of superclass type pointing to a subclass object, JVM uses the vtable to resolve the correct method at runtime.

```java
class Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Animal speaks"); }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void speak() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}

```

```java
Animal a = new Dog();
a.speak(); // Which method is called?
```

At runtime, JVM:

- Looks up a's actual class → Dog
- Follows the Dog class’s vtable
- Finds the speak() method → Dog.barks()
- Executes that

vtable is what makes polymorphism work.

`vtable` Construction Example:

```java
class A {
    void m1() {}
    void m2() {}
}

class B extends A {
    void m2() {} // override
    void m3() {}
}
```

| Class | vtable contents                            |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------ |
| A     | m1 → A.m1, m2 → A.m2                       |
| B     | m1 → A.m1, m2 → B.m2 (override), m3 → B.m3 |

Each class's vtable contains pointers to actual method implementations. JVM doesn't search the whole class hierarchy — it goes directly via vtable pointer.

#### What is an itable?

itable = "interface method table"

Used for interface dispatch, where things get trickier because:

- A class may implement multiple interfaces
- Interfaces may define the same method name but for different purposes

So JVM uses an itable (interface dispatch table) to:

- Map interface method signatures to actual implementation in the class

```java
interface Speakable {
    void speak();
}

class Human implements Speakable {
    public void speak() { System.out.println("Hi"); }
}

```

```java
Speakable s = new Human();
s.speak(); // JVM uses itable
```

`Human` has an itable entry mapping `Speakable.speak()` → `Human.speak()`

#### How is Type Info Stored in Metaspace?

Java Generics Are a Compile-Time Feature
Java uses type erasure to implement generics.

- Generic types exist only at compile time to ensure type safety
- At runtime, the JVM sees only the raw (non-generic) class
- The generic type parameters are erased

```java
List<String> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
List<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
```

At runtime, both are treated as just ArrayList.

So What Gets Stored in Metaspace?

1. Raw Type Information Only
   For generic classes like `ArrayList<T>`:

- The JVM stores only one copy of class metadata in Metaspace
- That metadata corresponds to the raw type: `ArrayList`

No matter how many times you write `ArrayList<String>`, `ArrayList<Integer>`, etc., they all share the same class metadata in Metaspace.

But What About Reflection?
Here’s the only place type parameter info is preserved — in class file metadata, for tools like reflection, annotation processing, and debuggers.

That info is stored in:

- Class file attributes (in the .class file)
- Stored in the runtime constant pool
- Loaded into Metaspace if needed (e.g., accessed via reflection)

```java
Field field = MyClass.class.getDeclaredField("list");
Type type = field.getGenericType();
System.out.println(type);  // prints java.util.List<java.lang.String>
```

This works because the compiler encoded that generic info in the class file, and the JVM loaded it as metadata, but it’s used only for introspection — not execution.

The compiler will:

- Compile list as a field of raw type List
- BUT it also writes the original type `List<String>` as a special attribute in the `.class` file.

This is called the **Signature attribute**.

#### Annotations & Reflection in JVM — How They Use Metaspace?

Where Are Annotations Stored?
Annotations live in the class file as attributes:

- At compile time, annotations are encoded in the .class file as metadata attributes (like RuntimeVisibleAnnotations)
- These are part of the constant pool and attribute table

At runtime:

- When the JVM loads the class (via the ClassLoader), this metadata is loaded into Metaspace
- But only if it is needed

Annotation Retention Policy: Controls Visibility

```java
@Retention(RUNTIME) // <--- Only this affects Metaspace at runtime
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
public @interface Loggable {}
```

Reflection — How It Uses Metaspace?
Java’s reflection API accesses the metadata of loaded classes.

```java
Method m = MyService.class.getMethod("doWork");
Annotation[] annotations = m.getDeclaredAnnotations();
```

The JVM pulls that data from:

- Metadata stored in Metaspace
- Specifically: attributes like RuntimeVisibleAnnotations that were parsed when the class was loaded

This is possible only if the annotation was compiled with @Retention(RUNTIME).

```java
@Retention(RUNTIME)
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@interface Track {}

class Service {
    @Track
    public void run() {}
}
```

At runtime:

```java
Method m = Service.class.getMethod("run");
Track track = m.getAnnotation(Track.class);
```

JVM:

- Looks in Metaspace where Service.class metadata is stored
- Finds the Track annotation inside the method's attributes
- Returns a proxy object representing the annotation

#### Under the Hood (HotSpot)

- When a class is loaded, the JVM:
  - Parses the class file attributes
  - If RuntimeVisibleAnnotations is present, it parses and caches them in the class’s metadata
  - These are stored in annotation maps inside Metaspace, per class/method/field
- When reflection is used:
  - The JVM checks these maps and constructs proxy objects to represent annotations

| Concept               | Where stored           | When loaded to Metaspace         | Accessible via Reflection? |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `@Retention(SOURCE)`  | Not stored             | Never                            | ❌ No                      |
| `@Retention(CLASS)`   | Class file only        | Not in Metaspace                 | ❌ No                      |
| `@Retention(RUNTIME)` | Class file + Metaspace | On class load                    | ✅ Yes                     |
| Reflection            | Uses Metaspace         | Reads parsed annotation metadata | ✅ Yes                     |
