# JVM GC Model - Generational Garbage Collection

Modern JVMs (e.g. HotSpot) use the Generational Hypothesis:
**Most objects die young.**

So the heap is divided:
| Generation | Purpose | GC Type |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Young Gen** | Holds short-lived objects | **Minor GC** |
| **Old Gen** | Holds long-lived objects | **Major / Full GC** |
| **(Optional) Metaspace (Java 8+)** | Class metadata | Native cleanup, not part of heap |

- Minor GC

  - Cleans Eden and Survivor spaces
  - Very fast because most objects are dead
  - **Stop-the-world**: all threads pause briefly
  - Uses copying algorithm: live objects are copied to survivor space

- Major / Full GC
  - Reclaims Old Generation memory
  - Involves **Mark** (identify live objects), **Sweep** (remove dead), **Compact** (defragment memory)
  - **Stop-the-world**
  - Can cause performance spikes

## Common GC types in JVM

1.  Serial GC

    - Single-threaded (even for multi-core CPUs)
    - Best for small apps or single-threaded environments
    - Options: `-XX:+UseSerialGC`

2.  Parallel GC (Throughput collector)

    - Multi-threaded GC for young and old gen
    - Focuses on throughput
    - Options: `-XX:+UseParallelGC`

3.  CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep) (deprecated)

    - Low pause GC (tries to avoid stop-the-world)
    - Works concurrently with application threads
    - Uses mark–sweep (no compaction → fragmentation risk)

4.  G1 (Garbage First) GC

    - Breaks heap into regions instead of fixed generations
    - Reclaims memory region-by-region (garbage-first)
    - Tries to provide predictable pause times
    - Enabled by default in Java 9+

5.  ZGC and Shenandoah (Low-Pause GCs)
    - Designed for huge heaps (100s of GBs)
    - Pause times in milliseconds
    - Mostly concurrent
    - Flags:
      - `-XX:+UseZGC`
      - `-XX:+UseShenandoahGC`

## How GC Algorithms work?

## 1. Copying Collector

The Copying Collector is one of the simplest and fastest GC algorithms. It's mainly used in the Young Generation of the JVM heap because:

- Most newly created objects die young
- So copying only the small number of surviving objects is cheaper than scanning the whole heap

The Young Generation is divided into:

- Eden space (where all new objects are created)
- Two Survivor spaces: S0 and S1 (also called FromSpace and ToSpace)

These are equal-sized regions.

### Trigger:

When Eden is full, a Minor GC is triggered.

### Steps:

1.  **Stop-the-world**: all application threads are paused
2.  Scan Eden + one Survivor space (S0) for live objects
3.  Copy live objects into the other Survivor space (S1)
4.  Age tracking: objects get an "age" counter (how many GCs they've survived)
    - If object’s age exceeds a threshold (`MaxTenuringThreshold`), it is promoted to Old Generation
5.  After copying:
    - Clear Eden and the scanned survivor space
    - Swap the survivor spaces: S1 becomes S0 for the next cycle

```text
Step 1: Object A, B, C created in Eden
Step 2: Eden full → Minor GC
Step 3:
    - A, B are alive → copied to S1
    - C is dead → discarded
Step 4: Eden and S0 cleared; S1 is now the active survivor space
```

### Downsides:

- Needs extra memory: one whole survivor space is unused at any time
- Not suitable for Old Gen where objects live long and are numerous
- All copying is **stop-the-world** — still causes a pause

### Tuning Parameters:

- `-XX:SurvivorRatio=8` → Eden is 8x larger than each survivor
- `-XX:MaxTenuringThreshold=5` → promote to Old Gen after 5 GCs

## 2. Mark–Sweep–Compact (MSC)

The Mark–Sweep–Compact algorithm is a multi-phase GC strategy that handles long-lived objects in the Old Generation. Unlike the Young Gen (where most objects die quickly), Old Gen contains persistent objects, so the GC must:

- Carefully identify live objects
- Reclaim the memory of dead objects
- Defragment the memory to ensure efficient allocation

  - ### Three Main Phases:

  1. Mark Phase:
     **"Find out what’s still alive."**

  - Starts from GC roots: thread stacks, static fields, JNI references, etc.
  - Recursively follows object references to mark all reachable (live) objects.

    Data structure:

    - JVM may use a bitmap or a color system (e.g., white for dead, black for live)

  2. Sweep Phase:
     **"Now that we know who’s alive, clear out the dead."**
     - JVM walks through the heap
     - Reclaims memory occupied by unmarked (dead) objects
     - This memory is now considered free space

  This leaves the heap fragmented — holes of free memory scattered among live objects

  3. Compact Phase:
     **"Move all live objects together to eliminate fragmentation."**
     - JVM shifts live objects to one side of the heap
     - Updates all object references (a process called pointer fixing)
     - After compaction, memory is contiguous again

**Used in Which Collectors?**

- Serial GC (Old Gen)
- Parallel GC (Old Gen)
- G1 GC (Old regions may be compacted selectively)
- Fallback for CMS when fragmentation is too high

### Downsides

- Long pause times (especially for large heaps)
- Requires pointer updates, which can be complex
- Can block all threads for hundreds of milliseconds or more

G1 GC and ZGC were designed specifically to overcome these downsides.

## 3. Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) — (_Deprecated_)

CMS is a low-pause garbage collector for the Old Generation designed to reduce stop-the-world times by doing most of its work concurrently with the application threads.
**Instead of freezing everything for a long time (like Mark-Sweep-Compact), do the “marking” part while the app is still running.**

- Deprecated in Java 9, removed in Java 14

Structure

- Young Gen: still uses copying collector
- Old Gen: collected by CMS
- PermGen (pre-Java 8) or Metaspace (Java 8+): holds class metadata

CMS GC Lifecycle (6 Phases):

1. Initial Mark (STW)

   - Quickly identifies objects that are directly reachable from GC roots
   - Stops all application threads (brief pause)

2. Concurrent Mark (Concurrent)

   - Traces and marks the rest of the live object graph
   - Runs while the application is running

3. Concurrent Preclean (Concurrent)

   - Captures any new references added during concurrent marking
   - Helps reduce work needed in the next STW phase

4. Remark (STW)

   - Final pass to catch changes made during concurrent mark
   - Short pause again (not as bad as a full GC)

5. Concurrent Sweep (Concurrent)
   - Reclaims memory of unreachable (dead) objects
   - Doesn’t compact memory

- But it can leave fragmented memory
- Can lead to `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError`: GC overhead limit exceeded if it can't find large enough contiguous blocks

### Issues

- Fragmentation: leads to failed allocations
- Concurrent mode failure: occurs if GC can't complete before heap fills up
- CPU-intensive: concurrent marking consumes CPU while app is running
- Deprecated: better alternatives now exist (G1, ZGC)

## 4. G1 GC (Garbage First Garbage Collector)

Garbage First (G1) GC, which is the modern default collector from Java 9 through Java 17. G1 was specifically designed to fix the problems of both Mark–Sweep–Compact and CMS.

G1 (Garbage First) is a region-based, mostly concurrent, low-pause-time garbage collector.

**Instead of collecting entire generations, G1 focuses on small regions of memory that contain the most garbage — hence the name "Garbage First".**

- Breaks the heap into many small pieces (called regions)
- Collects garbage from only the pieces with the most garbage first
- Tries to keep pause times low, even on large heaps (multi-GB)
- GC traverses the reference graph from GC roots.
- Any object not reachable from these roots is considered **unreachable** → **collectable**.

### How G1 organizes memory

Instead of fixed generations, G1 divides the entire heap into equal-sized regions (1–32MB each, depending on heap size).

Region Types:

- Eden: where new objects go
- Survivor: for young objects that survive
- Old: for long-lived objects
- Humongous: for very large objects (larger than 50% of a region)

```sql
Heap Regions:
+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+---------+
| Eden     | Old     | Eden     | S0       | Old      | S1      |
+----------+---------+----------+----------+----------+---------+

```

- G1 can have multiple Eden and Old regions
- Only one Survivor 0 and one Survivor 1 at a time (they swap roles)

### What Happens During GC?

1.  New objects go to Eden regions
2.  When Eden fills up → Young GC
3.  GC:
    - Copies surviving objects to Survivor region (S0 or S1)
    - If objects survive enough GCs, they are promoted to Old
4.  JVM may reassign region roles:
    - Eden → Old
    - Unused → Eden
    - etc.

### Survivor Space Rotation

G1 keeps two survivor regions and swaps them like this:

- At GC #1, use S0 as destination
- At GC #2, use S1 as destination
- The previous survivor region becomes the new Eden candidate

This allows it to track object age and decide promotion to Old generation.

### What’s different from other GCs?

- Classic GC:

  - Young Gen → whole Eden collected
  - Old Gen → whole Tenured space collected

- G1 GC:

  - “Hey, let me look at all my regions”
  - “Which ones are full of garbage?”
  - “I’ll collect just those first.”

    That's where the name comes from: **Garbage First**

### How G1 GC Works (step-by-step)

1. Heap Layout (at JVM startup)

   - Heap is split into hundreds/thousands of equal-sized regions
   - Region size = 1MB to 32MB (JVM decides based on heap size)

2. Young GC (Minor GC)

   - When Eden is full, a Minor GC is triggered.
   - G1 copies live objects from Eden → Survivor
   - Dead objects are discarded

3. Background GC Cycle (Old Gen)

   - When Old Gen starts to fill up, G1 starts a background GC cycle:

   Phases:

   - a. Initial Mark (STW):
     Marks all objects directly reachable from GC roots (thread stacks, static vars)

   - b. Concurrent Mark (Concurrent):
     Walks through object graph and marks all live objects

   Runs while app continues

   - c. Remark (STW):
     Double-checks objects created during concurrent mark

   Short pause

   - d. Cleanup:
     JVM scores each region based on how much garbage it contains

4. Evacuation (Compaction)
   - G1 chooses the regions with the most garbage
   - Moves live objects out of those regions (into free ones)
   - Frees the entire region in one go
   - Objects are compacted (defragged) in this process

This is why G1 solves fragmentation automatically — it evacuates and compacts as needed

`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100`
G1 will try to only evacuate as many regions as it can clean within 100ms.

### What happens with large (humongous) objects in G1 GC, and why they’re a problem?

A humongous object is any Java object that is too big to fit in a single region.
**If an object is ≥ 50% of a region's size, it is considered humongous and must be stored across multiple contiguous regions.**

Let’s say:

- Each G1 region = 4 MB
- You create a byte[] array of 10 MB

This object won’t fit into one region.
So G1 will reserve 3 full regions side-by-side just for that object.

```less
+--------+--------+--------+
| H1     | H2     | H3     |
+--------+--------+--------+
(One humongous object spanning 3 regions)
```

#### Why is this a problem?

- Case 1: Object is dead → ✅ Good
  - If the humongous object is no longer used, G1 will:
    - Detect it's unreachable
    - Reclaim all of its regions at once
  - Memory is freed efficiently
- Case 2: Object is live → ✅ Still OK
- Case 3: Object is partially live → 🚫 PROBLEM

The object isn’t completely dead, but only a part of it is still referenced (e.g., a huge array with 1 item used)

## 5. ZGC & Shenandoah GC — Next-Gen, Pause-Less Garbage Collection

**Keep GC pause times consistently under 10ms, regardless of heap size (even 100s of GBs).**

### ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)

ZGC is a concurrent, region-based, low-pause garbage collector.
Its main innovation is that it can move objects and compact memory without pausing application threads, using colored pointers and load barriers.

1.  Divide memory into regions

    - Just like G1 — the heap is made of equal-sized chunks.
    - No surprise here.

2.  Mark which objects are still alive

    - Most GCs pause the app to do this (stop-the-world).
    - ZGC does it while the app is running, using concurrent threads.
    - App keeps running ✅
    - GC figures out which objects are still in use ✅

3.  Move live objects to new memory

    - This is where ZGC becomes awesome.
    - Normally, moving objects requires pausing the app to fix all references.
    - ZGC says:
      **“No worries — I’ll move the object, and fix the references one by one, while your app runs.”**
    - It uses pointer coloring + barriers to do this safely.

      - Imagine object references (pointers) have color tags

      ```text
        [Object123 : color = Blue] → “This object might have moved.”
        [Object456 : color = Green] → “This object is already moved.”
      ```

      - Every time the app accesses an object:
      - ZGC sees the color tag
      - If the object has moved, it redirects to the new location instantly
      - And fixes the pointer

        It’s like forwarding your mail while you move houses. Seamless.

4.  Clean up unused memory

    - After all live objects are safely relocated, the old memory is now trash.
    - ZGC just reclaims that memory, all while the app continues to run.

    No full stop.
    No memory fragmentation.
    No "stop-the-world" cleanups.

### Shenandoah GC — Pause-less GC with Forwarding Barrier

Shenandoah GC is a concurrent, region-based, compacting GC that aims to keep pause times low by doing almost everything concurrently, including moving objects.
Just like ZGC, Shenandoah's main goal is sub-10ms pause times, even on heaps of hundreds of gigabytes.

1. Concurrent Mark

- Marks all live objects
- Runs while the app is running

2. Concurrent Evacuation

- Moves live objects to new locations
- Creates forwarding pointers at old locations
- Also runs concurrently

3. Concurrent Update References

- Application threads and GC threads update object references to point to new locations

4. Short Final Pause

- A tiny stop-the-world pause to clean up and swap states
- Usually < 10ms
