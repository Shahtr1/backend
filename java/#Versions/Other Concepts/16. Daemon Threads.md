A daemon thread is a low-priority, background thread that runs in support of other non-daemon (user) threads.

- Runs in the background (e.g., garbage collector, monitoring tasks)
- Dies automatically when no user threads remain
- Does not prevent JVM from exiting
- You must call `.setDaemon(true)` before calling `.start()`

```java
Thread t = new Thread(() -> {
    while (true) {
        System.out.println("Daemon running...");
    }
});
t.setDaemon(true);
t.start();

```

When to Use:

- Background monitoring
- Auto-refresh tasks
- Housekeeping jobs (with no need to finish execution)
