## Release Date: `February 6, 2002`

`Java 1.4`, also known as `Java 2 Standard Edition (J2SE) 1.4`, brought several important `new libraries and features`, enhancing the language's capabilities and usability.

## Key Features:

### 1. Regular Expressions:

Java 1.4 introduced the `java.util.regex` package, providing classes for pattern matching using regular expressions.

```java
import java.util.regex.*;

public class RegexExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Java 1.4 introduces regex";
        String patternString = "Java 1\\.4";

        Pattern pattern = Pattern.compile(patternString);
        Matcher matcher = pattern.matcher(text);

        boolean matches = matcher.matches();
        System.out.println("Matches: " + matches); // Outputs: Matches: true
    }
}

```

### 2. Assertions:

Assertions were introduced as a tool for debugging and testing, allowing developers to assert certain conditions in code.

```java
public class AssertionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int value = 5;
        assert value > 0 : "Value is not positive";
        System.out.println("Value is positive");
    }
}

// This code uses an assertion to check that value is positive. If value is not positive, an AssertionError is thrown.

```

### 3. NIO (New Input/Output):

The `java.nio package` was introduced, providing new file I/O capabilities, `buffers`, `channels`, and `selectors` for scalable network applications.

```java
import java.nio.*;
import java.nio.channels.*;
import java.io.IOException;

public class NioExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        FileChannel channel = new FileInputStream("example.txt").getChannel();
        ByteBuffer buffer = ByteBuffer.allocate(48);
        int bytesRead = channel.read(buffer);
        // ... Process the data
        channel.close();
    }
}

// This code snippet demonstrates reading data from a file using NIO.


```

### 4. Java Web Start and JNLP:

`Java Web Start`, for launching `standalone` Java applications from a `web browser`.

JNLP (Java Network Launch Protocol) support for easy `deployment` and `versioning`

### 5. XML Processing:

Integration of XML processing capabilities, with the addition of APIs like `JAXP` (`Java API for XML Processing`).

### 6. Logging API:

Introduction of a standard logging API (`java.util.logging`).

### 7. Security Enhancements:

Enhanced security features and APIs, including support for `SSL` and `TLS`.
