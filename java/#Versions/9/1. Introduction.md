## Release Date: `September 21, 2017`

`Java 9` was a landmark release primarily due to the introduction of the `Java Platform Module System (JPMS)`, also known as `Project Jigsaw`.

## Key Features:

1. ## Java Platform Module System (JPMS):

   Modules introduced a new way to organize and encapsulate Java applications and libraries, allowing for strong encapsulation and explicit module dependencies.

   ```java
   module com.example.myapp {
        requires java.sql;
        exports com.example.myapp.main;
    }

   ```

2. ## JShell: The Interactive Java REPL:

   A read-eval-print loop (REPL) for Java, making it easier to experiment with Java code snippets and learn the language's features.

   ```shell
    jshell> int a = 5;
    jshell> System.out.println(a);
   ```

3. ## Private Methods in Interfaces:

   Java 9 allowed private methods and private static methods in interfaces, facilitating code reuse among default methods.

   ```java
    public interface MyInterface {
        private static void privateMethod() {
            System.out.println("Private method in interface");
        }
        default void defaultMethod() {
            privateMethod();
        }
    }

   ```

4. ## Stream API Enhancements:

   Added new methods to the Stream interface, such as takeWhile, dropWhile, and ofNullable, enhancing the functional programming capabilities introduced in Java 8.

   ```java
   Stream.of(1, 2, 3, 2, 1)
      .dropWhile(n -> n < 3)
      .forEach(System.out::println); // Prints 3, 2, 1

   ```

5. ## Collection Factory Methods:

   Introduced convenient methods to create immutable collections.

   ```java
   List<String> list = List.of("a", "b", "c");
   ```

6. ## Process API Updates:

   Enhanced the API for controlling and managing operating-system processes.

   ```java
   ProcessHandle currentProcess = ProcessHandle.current();
   System.out.println("Current Process ID: " + currentProcess.pid());

   ```

7. ## HTTP/2 Client (Incubator):
   Introduced a new HTTP Client API supporting HTTP/2 and WebSocket, designed to replace the legacy `HttpURLConnection` API.
