## Release Date: `September 15, 2020`

## Key Features:

1.  ## Sealed Classes (Preview):

    Introduced to allow class designers to control which other classes or interfaces may extend or implement them.

    ```java
    public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square {
        // Class body
    }

    final class Circle extends Shape {
        // Class body
    }

    final class Square extends Shape {
        // Class body
    }

    ```

2.  ## Text Blocks (Standard)

3.  ## Pattern Matching for instanceof (Second Preview)

4.  ## Hidden Classes:
    Introduced hidden classes that cannot be used directly by the bytecode of other classes, useful for frameworks that generate classes at runtime.
