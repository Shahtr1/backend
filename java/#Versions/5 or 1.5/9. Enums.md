An `enum` (short for enumeration) is a special data type introduced in Java 5 (`java.lang.Enum`) to define a fixed set of constants. Unlike regular constants, Java enums are full-fledged classes, and each enum constant is a singleton instance.

```java
public enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING,
    PROCESSING,
    SHIPPED,
    DELIVERED,
    CANCELLED
}
```

Every enum constant is:

- An instance of the enum class.
- `public static final`.
- Instantiated once when the class is loaded.

So

```java
OrderStatus.SHIPPED instanceof OrderStatus // true
```

## Advanced Enum with Fields and Methods

```java
public enum OrderStatus {
    PENDING("P", "Awaiting Payment"),
    PROCESSING("PR", "Being Packed"),
    SHIPPED("S", "On the Way"),
    DELIVERED("D", "Delivered to Customer"),
    CANCELLED("C", "Cancelled by User");

    private final String code;
    private final String description;

    OrderStatus(String code, String description) {
        this.code = code;
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getCode() { return code; }
    public String getDescription() { return description; }
}

```

## Enum with Behavior (Polymorphism)

You can even give each constant custom behavior.

```java
public enum NotificationType {
    EMAIL {
        public void send(String msg) {
            System.out.println("Sending EMAIL: " + msg);
        }
    },
    SMS {
        public void send(String msg) {
            System.out.println("Sending SMS: " + msg);
        }
    };

    // It forces each enum constant to provide its own implementation of that method
    public abstract void send(String msg);
}

```

```java
NotificationType type = NotificationType.EMAIL;
type.send("Your order is shipped.");
```

## Enum in Java Persistence (JPA/Hibernate)

```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Enumerated(EnumType.STRING)
    private OrderStatus status;
}
```

This tells Hibernate to store the enum as a string in the database, not as an ordinal number.
