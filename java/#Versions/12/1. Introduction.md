## Release Date: `March 19, 2019`

## Key Features:

1.  ## Switch Expressions (Preview):

    Enhanced the switch statement to allow it to be used as either a statement or an expression, making code more concise and readable.

    ```java
    String result = switch (day) {
        case MONDAY, FRIDAY, SUNDAY -> "Weekend";
        case TUESDAY                -> "Weekday";
        default                     -> "Invalid day";
    };

    ```

2.  ## `Shenandoah`: A Low-Pause-Time Garbage Collector (Experimental)
