# How Keycloak Authentication + JWT + SSO Works in Java Microservices (CQRS + Axon)

## Step 1: User Opens Your Application (Frontend App)

Imagine your user ‚Äî say a supplier ‚Äî opens your frontend application:

```arduino
https://supplier-app.com
```

Your frontend is a **public client** (meaning it cannot keep secrets). It‚Äôs not responsible for storing passwords ‚Äî it delegates authentication to Keycloak.

The app shows a ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù button. When the user clicks it:

The app redirects the user to **Keycloak‚Äôs** login endpoint, using the **Authorization Code Flow**.

This is the redirect URL:

```perl
https://keycloak.company.com/auth/realms/supplier-finance/protocol/openid-connect/auth
?response_type=code
&client_id=frontend-app
&redirect_uri=https://supplier-app.com/callback
&scope=openid profile email
&state=abc123
&code_challenge=xyz789
&code_challenge_method=S256
```

| Query Param                  | Meaning                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `response_type=code`         | We're using the **Authorization Code Flow**            |
| `client_id=frontend-app`     | The name of the frontend client registered in Keycloak |
| `redirect_uri`               | Where Keycloak will send the user after login          |
| `scope=openid`               | Requests OpenID Connect support (for user identity)    |
| `code_challenge`             | A hashed random value (used in PKCE)                   |
| `code_challenge_method=S256` | Hashing method for the challenge (SHA-256)             |

Result of Step 1:

- User is redirected from your app to `Keycloak‚Äôs login` page.
- They now see a secure login form hosted by Keycloak.

## Step 2: Keycloak Login Page & Authentication

Now the user is on Keycloak‚Äôs hosted login page. This page is served directly by Keycloak, not your app.

What the User Sees:

A login form asking for:

- Username or Email
- Password

Optionally:

- A ‚ÄúForgot Password?‚Äù link
- A ‚ÄúRegister‚Äù link (if you enabled self-registration)
- Social logins (like Google, GitHub) ‚Äî if configured

What Happens Internally When the User Submits the Form:

1.  Keycloak checks the entered credentials against its user database for the realm (e.g., `supplier-finance`).

    - This DB might be internal, LDAP, Active Directory, or even a custom user provider.

2.  If credentials are invalid:

    - Keycloak shows an error on the login page.
    - The user stays on the login screen.

3.  If credentials are valid:

    - Keycloak logs the user in and creates a server-side login session.
    - This session is tracked using a Keycloak session cookie stored in the browser.
      - Cookie name: `KEYCLOAK_SESSION`
      - This is what enables **SSO** later (we'll cover that in Step 9).

4.  Keycloak now prepares to redirect the user back to your application, but it does not send a token yet. It sends a temporary code ‚Äî we‚Äôll handle that in Step 3.

Security Note:

- Your application never sees the password.
- Login happens entirely within Keycloak, which is the secure identity provider.

Result of Step 2:

- User is successfully authenticated.
- Keycloak has created a session for them.
- The browser is redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the URL.

## Step 3: Authorization Code is Returned to Your Application (Frontend)

After the user logs in successfully, Keycloak redirects the browser back to your frontend app ‚Äî to the `redirect_uri` you specified earlier.

Reditrect looks like:

```http
https://supplier-app.com/callback?code=abc123&state=xyz456
```

| Parameter      | Meaning                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `code=abc123`  | The **authorization code** ‚Äî a short-lived, single-use token |
| `state=xyz456` | A value sent earlier by the app to prevent CSRF attacks      |

Why Not Send the JWT Token Directly?
Because:

1.  `Security`: If someone intercepts the redirect, they can't do anything with this code.
2.  It allows **PKCE** to prove the app is legit.
3.  It separates user login from token issuance.

So now the frontend:

- Has an **authorization code**
- Will use it in the next step to securely get the **JWT** access token

### PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)

- This protects the flow from **interception**.
- The frontend generates a `code_verifier` ‚Üí hashes it ‚Üí sends it as `code_challenge`.

  1.  Frontend generates a `code_verifier`:
      When the frontend app starts the login process, it creates a random string like:
      ```plaintext
         code_verifier = "uQx9tm8uB30ZbsYpi1kOka3nY0U"
      ```
      This is stored temporarily in memory (not sent yet).
  2.  Frontend generates a `code_challenge` from that verifier
      It hashes the `code_verifier` using **SHA-256**, and encodes it in Base64:

      ```plaintext
         code_challenge = BASE64URL-ENCODE(SHA256(code_verifier))
      ```

      Example:
      code_challenge = "LzJZyQ...abc"

      This hashed challenge is sent to Keycloak in the redirect URL during the login request:

      ```http
      https://keycloak.company.com/auth/realms/supplier-finance/protocol/openid-connect/auth
      ?response_type=code
      &client_id=frontend-app
      &redirect_uri=...
      &code_challenge=LzJZyQ...abc
      &code_challenge_method=S256
      ```

  3.  User logs in at Keycloak ‚Üí Keycloak redirects back
      Once login succeeds, Keycloak **does not give the token yet**. It instead gives a temporary code (like a claim ticket).

      ```http
      https://supplier-app.com/callback?code=abc123
      ```

      This `code` is only useful if you can prove you know the original `code_verifier`.

  4.  Frontend exchanges the code for a token
      Now the frontend sends a secure POST request to Keycloak‚Äôs `/token` endpoint:

      ```http
      POST /token

      Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

      grant_type=authorization_code
      code=abc123
      client_id=frontend-app
      redirect_uri=https://supplier-app.com/callback
      code_verifier=uQx9tm8uB30ZbsYpi1kOka3nY0U ‚Üê üîë original one
      ```

  What Keycloak does here:

  - It takes the `code_verifier`, hashes it using SHA-256
  - Compares it to the original `code_challenge` it got in Step 2
  - If they match ‚Üí ‚úÖ authentication is verified and secure
  - Keycloak issues the access token (JWT) and optional refresh token

  Why is PKCE Important?
  Without PKCE:

  - An attacker could intercept the code (in Step 3) and use it to get a token themselves.

  With PKCE:

  - The attacker doesn‚Äôt have the code_verifier, so the token exchange will fail.

  It proves: **‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôm the same app that started this login request.‚Äù**

## Step 4: Frontend Exchanges Authorization Code for Access Token (JWT)

Response from Keycloak
If everything is valid, Keycloak responds with:

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "expires_in": 300,
  "refresh_token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
}
```

Token Breakdown:

1.  Access Token (JWT)

- This is the main token.
- It contains your user identity, roles, issuer, expiration, etc.
- It‚Äôs what your frontend will attach to every API call.

2.  Refresh Token

- Used to get a new access token when it expires (instead of logging in again).
- Should be stored securely and only used if needed.

3.  ID Token

- Only used if you're displaying identity info in the frontend.
- Often used for displaying the user‚Äôs name or avatar.

Security Note:

- This step MUST happen over **HTTPS**
- The `code_verifier` prevents attacks even if someone hijacks the code

Result of Step 4:

- Your frontend app now has a **valid Access Token (JWT)**
- It will now send this token to your backend microservices to prove the user‚Äôs identity

## Step 5: What‚Äôs Inside a JWT Token?

When your frontend gets the Access Token from Keycloak, it looks like a long string:

```text
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJzdWIiOiJ1c2VyLTEyMyIsInByZWZlcnJlZF91c2VybmFtZSI6ImNsYXkiLCJyb2xlcyI6WyJTVVBQTElFUiJdLCJleHAiOjE3MjM0NTg0MDAsImlhdCI6MTcyMzQ1NTAwMCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9rZXljbG9hay5jb20vcmVhbG1zL3N1cHBsaWVyLWZpbmFuY2UifQ.
signatureHere
```

That‚Äôs a **JWT**: a **JSON Web Token**. It‚Äôs just a Base64-encoded, signed JSON object ‚Äî like a digital ID card.

What Happens When You Decode It?
You can paste it into https://jwt.io and see 3 parts:

1. Header

```json
{
  "alg": "RS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

| Field | Meaning                                                 |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `alg` | Signing algorithm used (e.g., RS256 = RSA with SHA-256) |
| `typ` | Token type (JWT)                                        |

2. Payload (Claims)

This is the actual user information. Example:

```json
{
  "sub": "user-123",
  "preferred_username": "clay",
  "email": "clay@example.com",
  "realm_access": {
    "roles": ["SUPPLIER"]
  },
  "iat": 1723455000,
  "exp": 1723458600,
  "iss": "https://keycloak.company.com/realms/supplier-finance",
  "aud": "frontend-app"
}
```

| Field                | Meaning                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `sub`                | Subject = unique ID of the user                          |
| `preferred_username` | Username to display                                      |
| `email`              | User‚Äôs email address                                     |
| `realm_access.roles` | List of user‚Äôs assigned roles                            |
| `iat`                | Issued At (UNIX timestamp)                               |
| `exp`                | Expiration time                                          |
| `iss`                | Issuer = which Keycloak realm issued the token           |
| `aud`                | Audience = which client (app) this token is intended for |

3. Signature

The third part is a **cryptographic signature**, created with Keycloak‚Äôs private key.

- Your microservices use Keycloak‚Äôs public key to verify that:
  - This token is valid
  - It hasn‚Äôt been modified

What Makes JWT Powerful?

- It‚Äôs stateless: contains all the info needed ‚Äî no database lookup
- It‚Äôs signed: can‚Äôt be tampered with
- It contains roles ‚Üí so your backend can easily enforce access control

Where This Fits in Your Flow
From now on, your frontend will send this token with every request to the backend:

```http
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

And your backend will:

1.  Decode it
2.  Verify it
3.  Read roles and user ID from it

Result of Step 5:

- You now understand exactly what‚Äôs inside a JWT
- It‚Äôs a signed, self-contained identity card
- Your backend will use it to authenticate and authorize users

## Step 6: Frontend Sends JWT to Backend (Microservices)

Now that your frontend has the **Access Token (JWT)** from Keycloak, it needs to send it to your backend microservices to:

- Prove the user is authenticated
- Allow or deny access based on their roles

Every API Request from Frontend Looks Like This:

```http
GET /api/invoices/123
Host: api.supplier-app.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

The Authorization header uses the "**Bearer**" scheme, meaning:
‚ÄúThis is the token that proves who I am ‚Äî trust it.‚Äù

What Happens on the Backend (Microservice)?

Each microservice is configured as a resource server in Spring Boot. That means it knows how to:

- Accept a JWT token
- Verify that it's valid
- Extract user info (subject, roles, etc.)
- Reject unauthorized or expired tokens

Spring Boot Configuration (in your microservice)

```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://keycloak.company.com/realms/supplier-finance
```

This tells Spring Security:

- ‚ÄúGo fetch the public key from Keycloak‚Äù
- ‚ÄúUse it to validate every incoming JWT token‚Äù

When a request comes in with a token, Spring Security will:

1.  Decode the JWT
2.  Check:
    - Signature: is it valid?
    - Expiration: is it still valid?
    - Issuer: was it issued by the right Keycloak realm?
3.  Convert the `roles` from the JWT into Spring Security authorities

So you don‚Äôt need to write your own token parser ‚Äî it‚Äôs all handled for you.

Now You Can Secure Methods with Roles

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('SUPPLIER')")
@PostMapping("/invoices")
public ResponseEntity<Void> createInvoice(...) {
    commandGateway.send(new CreateInvoiceCommand(...));
    return ResponseEntity.ok().build();
}
```

Result of Step 6:

- Your frontend is sending the JWT on every request
- Your microservices validate the token automatically
- You can now protect your APIs based on roles from the token

## Step 7: Backend Validates the JWT (Spring Boot Resource Server + Keycloak)

This step is all about how your backend microservices (e.g., `invoice-command-service`, `invoice-query-service`) **trust and verify** the JWT that the frontend sends.

At this point, your microservice acts like a customs officer:

- It inspects every token (passport)
- It checks its authenticity, validity, and permissions

```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: https://keycloak.company.com/realms/supplier-finance
```

### Internally, Spring Does:

1.  Downloads the **JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)** from:

```ruby
https://keycloak.company.com/realms/supplier-finance/protocol/openid-connect/certs
```

This JWKS contains the **public keys** used to verify the signature of tokens.

2. Validates the token:

- Is the JWT well-formed?
- Was it signed using the correct key?
- Has it expired?
- Does `iss` match the issuer URI?
- Does the token have the correct audience (`aud`)?

3. Extracts the user info (claims) from the token:

```json
{
  "preferred_username": "clay",
  "realm_access": {
    "roles": ["SUPPLIER", "USER"]
  },
  "sub": "user-123",
  "exp": 1723459200
}
```

These claims are turned into a `JwtAuthenticationToken` object that Spring uses in the current **security context**.

4. Applies method-level security:

```java
@PreAuthorize("hasRole('SUPPLIER')")
```

How Roles Are Mapped
By default, Keycloak puts roles under:

```json
"realm_access": {
  "roles": ["SUPPLIER", "FINANCIER"]
}
```

Spring needs to be told to **treat those as authorities**.

Optionally, you can define a custom `JwtAuthenticationConverter` in your config to read them properly:

```java
@Bean
public JwtAuthenticationConverter jwtAuthenticationConverter() {
    JwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter converter = new JwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter();
    converter.setAuthoritiesClaimName("realm_access.roles");
    converter.setAuthorityPrefix("ROLE_");

    JwtAuthenticationConverter jwtConverter = new JwtAuthenticationConverter();
    jwtConverter.setJwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter(converter);
    return jwtConverter;
}
```

This makes sure SUPPLIER from the token becomes `ROLE_SUPPLIER` in Spring Security.

Result of Step 7:

- Your microservice verifies every token
- It checks validity, issuer, expiration, signature, and roles
- It securely determines if a user can perform the action based on the token content

## Step 8: Handling Token Expiration and Refresh Tokens

JWT access tokens ‚Äî like the one issued by Keycloak ‚Äî are short-lived by design.

| Token Type             | Purpose                        | Lifetime                               |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Access Token** (JWT) | Used for API calls             | ‚è≥ 5‚Äì15 minutes                        |
| **Refresh Token**      | Used to get a new access token | üîÅ 30 minutes to several hours or days |

You can configure both durations in the Keycloak admin panel under:
`Realm ‚Üí Clients ‚Üí frontend-app ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Access Token Lifespan`

How the Refresh Flow Works
Let‚Äôs say:

- The `Access Token` expires after 5 minutes
- But the user is still active in your frontend app

Instead of forcing them to log in again, the frontend can use the `Refresh Token` to get a new Access Token `without user interaction`.

POST Request to Keycloak (from the frontend or backend):

```http
POST https://keycloak.company.com/auth/realms/supplier-finance/protocol/openid-connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=refresh_token
&client_id=frontend-app
&refresh_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6...
```

Response from Keycloak:

```json
{
  "access_token": "new JWT token here",
  "refresh_token": "new refresh token",
  "expires_in": 300
}
```

Keycloak usually gives a **new refresh token** as well ‚Äî this is called refresh token rotation, and it's a good security practice.

What Happens if Both Tokens Expire?
Then the user is **no longer authenticated** and must:

- Be redirected to Keycloak login page again
- Start the Authorization Code Flow from scratch

## Step 9: Single Sign-On (SSO) in Keycloak

What Is SSO?

A user logs in once, and then they can access multiple applications without logging in again ‚Äî as long as those apps trust the same identity provider (Keycloak in this case).

How Does SSO Work in Keycloak

Let‚Äôs say your system has 3 apps:

- `https://supplier-app.com`
- `https://admin-dashboard.com`
- `https://reporting-tool.com`

All of them are registered as `clients in the same Keycloak realm`.

What Happens When a User Logs into One App?

Scenario:

1.  User logs into supplier-app.com
2.  Keycloak authenticates them and creates a **login session**
3.  Keycloak sets a **secure browser cookie** (e.g., `KEYCLOAK_SESSION`) for its domain
4.  The browser keeps this cookie for the duration of the session

Now the User Opens Another App:

They go to:

```plaintext
https://admin-dashboard.com
```

What happens?

- That app also redirects to Keycloak for login.
- But Keycloak sees the existing session cookie in the browser.
- So Keycloak doesn‚Äôt show the login form again.
- It immediately redirects back to the app with a new authorization code.
- The app then gets a new access token.

üîÑ The user never sees a second login screen. That‚Äôs the SSO effect.

Where Is the Session Stored?

- The session is stored server-side in Keycloak (not in your app).
- It's tracked by a cookie scoped to the Keycloak domain.
- The browser sends that cookie on every redirect to Keycloak.

Bonus: Global Logout
You can provide a "Logout Everywhere" feature by calling:

```http
GET /protocol/openid-connect/logout
```

Result of Step 10:

- Users authenticate once, use many apps without interruption
- Centralized identity and access control via Keycloak
- Great UX, reduced password fatigue, and improved security
