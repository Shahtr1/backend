## Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, return the **longest palindromic substring** in `s`.

Input:

- A string `s`

Output:

- A substring of `s` which is the longest contiguous palindrome

Constraints:

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of only printable ASCII characters

Example 1:

```makefile
Input: s = "babad"
Output: "bab"
Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
```

Example 2:

```makefile
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: "bb"
```
