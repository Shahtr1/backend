## Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers `nums`, and there is a sliding window of size `k` that moves from the left to the right of the array.
You need to return the maximum in each window.

Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

Example 1:

```makefile
Input:  nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
```

Example 2:

```makefile
Input:  nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
