## Find the duplicate number in an array without modifying the array

Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.
There is only one repeated number, but it could be repeated more than once.

You must not modify the array and must use only constant extra space.

Constraints:

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `nums.length == n + 1`
- Each integer is in the range `[1, n]`
- Only one number is repeated, but it can be repeated more than once.
- You must not modify the input array.
- You must use only constant extra space.
- Your runtime complexity must be `less than O(nÂ²)`.

Example 1:

```makefile
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2
Example 2:
```

```makefile
Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,2]
Output: 3
```
