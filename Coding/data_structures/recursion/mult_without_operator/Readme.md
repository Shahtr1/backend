## Problem Statement:

Recursive Multiplication Without Using the `*` Operator

You are required to implement a method that performs multiplication of two integers without using the multiplication operator `*`.

Input

- Two integers, `a` and `b`, where:
- `-10^4 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^4`

Output

- An integer representing the product of `a` and `b`.

Constraints

- You must not use the `*` operator.
- Your implementation should handle negative numbers and zero appropriately.

Example

```java
Input: a = -3, b = 5
Output: -15
```
