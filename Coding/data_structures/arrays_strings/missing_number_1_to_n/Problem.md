## Problem Statement:

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the one number that is missing from the array.

Input:

- An integer array nums of length `n`, where the elements are distinct and range from `0 to n`.

Output:

- An integer representing the missing number.

Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All numbers are distinct
- Exactly one number is missing

Example 1:

```makefile
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
Output: 2
```

Example 2:

```makefile
Input: nums = [0, 1]
Output: 2
```

Example 3:

```makefile
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```
