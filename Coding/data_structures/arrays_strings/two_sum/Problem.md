## Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

Assume:

- Each input would have exactly one solution
- You may not use the same element twice

Return the answer in any order.

Constraints:

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`

Example 1:

```makefile
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

Example 2:

```makefile
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

Example 3:

```makefile
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```
